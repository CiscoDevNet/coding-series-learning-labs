# Coding 201: Parsing XML using Python #

In this Learning Lab you will learn the basics of parsing XML content using Python.  We will use the [CMX Mobility Services](https://developer.cisco.com/site/cmx-mobility-services/ "CMX Mobility Services") as a data source and query for the names of the available access points and put them into a simple list for display.  If you want to dig deeper into CMX, review the [Mobility Services Engine (MSE) Learning Lab](#/labs/cmx/step/1).


## Objectives ##

Completion Time: 20 minutes

* Understand the basics of reading and parsing XML content via HTTP using Python
* Evaluate data returned from the CMX Mobility Service API
* Learn how to use Python to extract only the XML data you want using Minidom


## Prerequisites

You will want to make sure you have gone through the [Coding 101 lab](#/labs/coding-101-rest-basics/step/1 "Coding 101 Lab") if you are unfamiliar with Python and retrieving results from a RESTful service.

You should also have a basic familiarity with XML.  If you do not, consider visiting the [W3Schools XML Tutorial](http://www.w3schools.com/xml "W3Schools XML Tutorial") to get a firm base to build upon.

For this lab we will be using Python 3.4+.  If you are on a DevNet Zone station, the correct version of Python should already be installed.  If you are following this lab online, you can verify your version run the following command at a terminal or command prompt window:
```
    python --version
```

## Step 1. Make a HTTP REST call with Python

To get started, create a simple Python script that can make a HTTP request to the CMX MSE Server.

1. Open the text editor and create a file named **get-ap-xml.py**.
2. Save **get-ap-xml.py** to the desktop.
3. Within the text editor add the following lines to **get-ap-xml.py**:
```
from urllib.request import Request, urlopen
req = Request('https://msesandbox.cisco.com/api/contextaware/v1/maps/info/DevNetCampus/DevNetBuilding/DevNetZone')
req.add_header('Authorization', 'Basic bGVhcm5pbmc6bGVhcm5pbmc==')
response = urlopen(req)
responseString = response.read().decode("utf-8")
print(responseString)
response.close()
```
In this snippet, we are:
	-  Importing the required Request and urlopen libraries
	-  Constructing a request to the CMX URI
	-  Adding Basic authentication to our Request
	-  Opening the request and getting a Response back from the CMX URI
	-  Parsing the Response as a String and printing it out to the console
<br/>
<br/>
4. Save the **get-ap-xml.py** file.  If you want to just download or review the current code, you can get it from GitHub <a href="https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/coding-skills-sample-code/blob/master/coding201-parsing-xml/get-ap-xml-1.py" target="_blank">here</a>.
5. Open a command prompt.<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If your are using the Windows OS, type the following command into the command prompt window to move to your desktop:
```
cd %USERPROFILE%\Desktop
```
&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are using OS X, type the following command into the terminal window to move to your desktop:
```
cd ~/Desktop
```
6. In the command prompt window, type the following command to execute your newly created file using Python:
```
python get-ap-xml.py
```
Note: You may need to run the python command as <b>python3.4 get-ap-xml.py</b> on OS X to force using the 3.4 version of Python.  If you get any errors, verify the version of python being executed and double-check the code.
<br/>
<br/>
7. When you run the Python script, you should get an screen full of XML data returned to the terminal.

----------

By default, CMX will return the data in XML.  For this first step, this is what we want.  Let's clean up this data parse out something more specific in the next step.
