# Coding 201: Parsing XML using Python  

In this Learning Lab, you learn the basics of parsing XML content using Python. The example runs a query on [CMX Mobility Services](https://developer.cisco.com/site/cmx-mobility-services/ "CMX Mobility Services") data for available access points and put their names into a simple list for display. To learn more about CMX, review the [Mobility Services Engine (MSE) Learning Lab](lab/cmx/step/1).

## Objectives

* Understand the basics of reading and parsing XML content from HTTP using Python.
* Evaluate data returned from the CMX Mobility Service API.
* Use Python to extract only the XML data you want, using Minidom.

## Prerequisites

Go through the [Coding 101 lab](lab/coding-101-rest-basics-ga/step/1 "Coding 101 Lab") if you are unfamiliar with Python and retrieving results from a RESTful service.

You should be familiar with XML. Otherwise, consider visiting the [W3Schools XML Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/xml "W3Schools XML Tutorial") to get a firm base to build upon.

For this lab, use Python 3.4+. If you are on a DevNet Zone station, the correct version of Python should already be installed. If you are following this lab online, check the version by entering the following command in a terminal or command prompt window:
```
python --version
```

## Example: Make an HTTP REST call with Python

> **Note**: The example uses a CMX MSE Server, where you would need to have access to one and substitute here. 

To get started, this walk-through shows creating a simple Python script that sends an HTTP request to a CMX MSE Server.

Example `get-ap-xml.py` file:
```
from urllib.request import Request, urlopen
req = Request('https://<ServerURLorIPAddress>/api/contextaware/v1/maps/info/DevNetCampus/DevNetBuilding/DevNetZone')
req.add_header('Authorization', 'Basic bGVhcm5pbmc6bGVhcm5pbmc=')
response = urlopen(req)
responseString = response.read().decode("utf-8")
print(responseString)
response.close()
```

  This snippet shows:
  	-  Importing the required `Request` and `urlopen` libraries.
  	-  Constructing a request to the CMX URI.
  	-  Adding basic authentication to your Request.
  	-  Opening the request and getting a response back from the CMX URI.
  	-  Parsing the response as a string and printing it to the console.    

To download or review the current code, you can get it from GitHub <a href="https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/coding-skills-sample-code/blob/master/coding201-parsing-xml/get-ap-xml-1.py" target="_blank">here</a>.

If you are using Windows, enter the following command into the command prompt window to move to your computer:
```
cd %USERPROFILE%\Desktop
```
If you are using OS X, enter the following command into the terminal to move to your computer:
```
cd ~/Desktop
```
In the command prompt window, enter the following command:
```
python get-ap-xml.py
```

> **Note**: On OS X, to use Python 3.4, you may need to enter `python3.4 get-ap-xml.py`. If you get errors, verify the version of python and double-check the code.

When you run the Python script, the terminal displays a screen full of XML data.

----------

By default, CMX returns the data in XML. For this first step, this is what you want. In the next step, you will clean up this data and display something more specific.

### Next step

Proceed to Step 2: Understand the returned XML data.
