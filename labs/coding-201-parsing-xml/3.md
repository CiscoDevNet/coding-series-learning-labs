## Step 3. Getting XML Elements in Python

### Iterating through Elements in XML

Because you know the structure of the returned XML, the first approach could be to get the first element and sift through that elements children looking for the ones that match what you are looking for. This could be the tag name of the element, a particular value of an attribute, whether or not a child has sub-elements, or even the element's position in the hierarchy of the XML document. For example, you may want to get only the 3rd-level children from the root of the document. Another example might be that you want to get all of the child nodes with a particular attribute whose value is `0.0`.

To understand how this might work, modify your script to include some code that loops through the children looking for the information you want to collect. Here, find the `AccessPoint` elements and output their names and Ethernet MAC addresses.

1. In `get-ap-xml.py`, insert the following between the `print(xml)` and `response.close()` lines. Keep the spaces because Python is sensitive to indentation.
```python
floor_element = dom.firstChild
if floor_element.hasChildNodes :
    child = floor_element.firstChild
    while child is not None:
        if child.tagName == 'AccessPoint' :
            output = child.tagName + ": " + child.getAttribute('name') + '\t eth: ' + child.getAttribute('ethMacAddress')
            print(output)
        child = child.nextSibling
```
This snippet:
	-  Gets the first element from the Document Object Model (DOM).
	-  Determines if the first element has children.
	-  If the first element has children, it begins iterating through them.
	-  For each child, if its tag name is `AccessPoint`, print out its `name` and `ethMacAddress` attribute information.

2. Save the `get-ap-xml.py` file. To download or review the current code, you can get it from GitHub <a href="https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/coding-skills-sample-code/blob/master/coding201-parsing-xml/get-ap-xml-3.py" target="_blank">here</a>.

3. Enter the following command to run your file.
```
python get-ap-xml.py
```
Note: On OS X, to use Python 3.4, you may need to enter `python3.4 get-ap-xml.py`. If you get errors, verify the version of python and double-check the code.

When you run the Python script, you should get an output at the end of the data values extracted from the XML returned for each Access Point.

----------

Using Python and Minidom, you have extracted specific information from CMX using the Floor element and iterated through each child. This can be a useful in some scenarios. However, what if you want to quickly get the `AccessPoints` and you don't care about anything else in the document?  Next, look at how you could parse that out quickly.
