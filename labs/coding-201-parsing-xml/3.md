## Step 3. Getting XML Elements in Python 

### Iterating through Elements in XML

Since we know the structure of the returned XML, the first approach could be to simply get the first element and sift through that elements children looking for the ones that match what we are looking for.  This could be the Tag name of the element, a particular value of an Attribute, whether or not a child has sub-elements itself, or even just its position in the hierarchy of the XML document.  For example, we may only want to get all the 3rd level children from the root of the document. Another example might be that we want to get all the child nodes that have an Attribute of "x" with a value of "0.0".

To understand how this might work, let's modify our script so far and include some code to loop through the children looking for information we want to collect.  For this example, lets look for AccessPoint elements and output their name and Ethernet MAC Address.

1. In **get-ap-xml.py**, insert the following between the print(xml) and response.close() lines.  Be sure keep the the spaces as Python is sensitive to indentation.
```
floor_element = dom.firstChild
if floor_element.hasChildNodes :
    child = floor_element.firstChild
    while child is not None:
        if child.tagName == 'AccessPoint' :
            output = child.tagName + ": " + child.getAttribute('name') + '\t eth: ' + child.getAttribute('ethMacAddress')
            print(output)
        child = child.nextSibling
```
In this snippet, we are:
	-  Getting the first element from the Document Object Model (DOM)
	-  Determining if the first element has children
	-  If the first element has children, begin iterating through them
	-  For each child we find, see if its Tag name is "AccessPoint", if it is print out its **name** and **ethMacAddress** attribute information

2. Save the **get-ap-xml.py** file. If you want to just download or review the current code, you can get it from GitHub <a href="https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/coding-skills-sample-code/blob/master/coding201-parsing-xml/get-ap-xml-3.py" target="_blank">here</a>.
3. Run the following command to execute your file.
```
python get-ap-xml.py
```
Note: You may need to run the python command as <b>python3.4 get-ap-xml.py</b> on OS X to force using the 3.4 version of Python.  If you get any errors, verify the version of python being executed and double-check the code.
<br/>
<br/>
When you run the Python script, you should get an output at the end of the data values extracted from the XML returned for each Access Point.

----------

Using Python and Minidom, we have extracted specific information from CMX using the Document root Floor element and iterated through each child.  This can be a useful in some scenarios but what if we just want to quickly get the AccessPoints and we don't really care about anything else in the document?  Let's look at how we could parse that out quickly.
