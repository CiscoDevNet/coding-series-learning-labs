## Step 4. Getting XML Elements in Python

### Retrieving Elements by Tag Name

Rather than manually evaluate each child in a series of nodes, Minidom offers functionality to extract a collection of elements by their tag name. You can use the `getElementsByTagName()` method to return an array of elements.

1. In `get-ap-xml.py`, replace the code you inserted in Step 3 (everything between the `print(xml)` and `response.close()` lines) with the following code. (Be careful to maintain the indentation.)

```python
access_points = dom.getElementsByTagName('AccessPoint')
for access_point in access_points:
    ap_name = access_point.getAttribute('name')
    ap_eth_addr = access_point.getAttribute('ethMacAddress')
    ap_ip_addr = access_point.getAttribute('ipAddress')
    print(access_point.tagName + ": " + ap_name + '\t eth: ' + ap_eth_addr + '\t ip: ' + ap_ip_addr)
```

This snippet:
	-  Gets elements whose tag is `AccessPoint`.
	-  Iterates through those elements.
	-  For each child, prints out its `name`, `ethMacAddress`, and `ipAddress` attribute information.

2. Save the `get-ap-xml.py` file. To download or review the current code, you can get it from GitHub <a href="https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/coding-skills-sample-code/blob/master/coding201-parsing-xml/get-ap-xml-4.py" target="_blank">here</a>.

3. Enter the following command to run your file.
```
python get-ap-xml.py
```
Note: On OS X, to use Python 3.4, you may need to enter `python3.4 get-ap-xml.py`. If you get errors, verify the version of python and double-check the code.

When you run the Python script, it should return output that is similar to what you saw before, with the the IP Address for each Access Point.
