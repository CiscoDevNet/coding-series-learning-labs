## Step 4. Getting XML Elements in Python

### Retrieving Elements by Tag Name

Rather than manually evaluate each child in a series of nodes, Minidom offers functionality to extract a collection of elements by their tag name.  We can use the `getElementsByTagName()` method to return an array of elements.

1. In **get-ap-xml.py**, strip out what was inserted in Step 3 (everything between the print(xml) and response.close() lines) and insert the following in its place.  Again, be careful in maintaining the indentation.
```
access_points = dom.getElementsByTagName('AccessPoint')
for access_point in access_points:
    ap_name = access_point.getAttribute('name')
    ap_eth_addr = access_point.getAttribute('ethMacAddress')
    ap_ip_addr = access_point.getAttribute('ipAddress')
    print(access_point.tagName + ": " + ap_name + '\t eth: ' + ap_eth_addr + '\t ip: ' + ap_ip_addr)
```
In this snippet, we are:
	-  Getting the Elements by their Tag name of "AccessPoint"
	-  Iterate through the found elements as Access Points
	-  For each child we find, print out its **name**, **ethMacAddress**, and **ipAddress** attribute information

2. Save the **get-ap-xml.py** file. If you want to just download or review the current code, you can get it from GitHub <a href="https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/coding-skills-sample-code/blob/master/coding201-parsing-xml/get-ap-xml-4.py" target="_blank">here</a>.
3. Run the following command to execute your file.
```
python get-ap-xml.py
```
Note: You may need to run the python command as <b>python3.4 get-ap-xml.py</b> on OS X to force using the 3.4 version of Python.  If you get any errors, verify the version of python being executed and double-check the code.
<br/>
<br/>
When you run the Python script, you should get a very similar output to before with the inclusion of the IP Address for each Access Point.

----------

Using Python and Minidom, we have extracted specific information from CMX using the Element Tag name and were able to output only the data we were looking for from this CMX data.

Let's move to the last step and learn about resources available to further your knowledge of parsing XML with Python.
