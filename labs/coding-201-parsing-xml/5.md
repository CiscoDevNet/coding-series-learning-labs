## Step 5. Additional Resources 

For more information on the topics we touch on in this lab, please visit a related section for more information.

### Extensible Markup Language (XML)

If the terminology in use by XML documents is still confusing, a good next step would be to familiarize yourself with Extensible Markup Language (XML) at the W3schools website: [http://www.w3schools.com/xml/](http://www.w3schools.com/xml/ "W3Schools XML")  

For a deeper dive into XML, you can review the Extensible Markup Language (XML) standard at [http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/](http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/ "Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0 (Fifth Edition)")


### Python

Python is a powerful tool and we just scratched the surface of its capabilities by reaching out and pulling down a result from a remote URI.  If you are interested in learning more, look to the Python tutorial at [https://docs.python.org/3.4/tutorial/](https://docs.python.org/3.4/tutorial/ "Python Tutorial") to get started.

**Python XML Libraries**<br/>
It is important to note that there are several libraries and approaches to parsing XML content: The Minidom library we used in this lab is just one tool.  For example, [ElementTree](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html "ElementTree XML API") is another popular Python libary that is used to parse XML.

A good summary of the major standard and external libraries available can be found at the python.org wiki at [https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonXml](https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonXml "PythonXML").

Additionally, there is a good overview of the Python modules available for Stream and Document Object Model parsing is available at [https://docs.python.org/3.4/whatsnew/2.0.html#xml-modules](https://docs.python.org/3.4/whatsnew/2.0.html#xml-modules "XML-Modules").
