## Step 5. Additional Resources

The following sections provide additional resources for learning about the topics that were covered by this lab.

### Extensible Markup Language (XML)

If some of the XML terminology is still confusing, a good next step would be to visit: [http://www.w3schools.com/xml/](http://www.w3schools.com/xml/ "W3Schools XML").

To learn more about XML, you can also review the XML standard at [http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/](http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/ "Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0 (Fifth Edition)").


### Python

Python is a powerful tool. To learn more, use the  [https://docs.python.org/3.4/tutorial/](https://docs.python.org/3.4/tutorial/ "Python Tutorial").

**Python XML Libraries**<br/>
There are several libraries and approaches for parsing XML content. The Minidom library you used in this lab is one tool. Another popular Python library is  [ElementTree](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html "ElementTree XML API").

You can find a good summary of the major standard and external libraries at [https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonXml](https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonXml "PythonXML").

Additionally, for an overview of the Python modules for Stream and Document Object Model parsing, see [https://docs.python.org/3.4/whatsnew/2.0.html# xml-modules](https://docs.python.org/3.4/whatsnew/2.0.html# xml-modules "XML-Modules").
