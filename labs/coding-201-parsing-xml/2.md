## Step 2. Understanding the returned XML data

Before we begin parsing the returned XML, let's take a moment to understand what the XML actually represents and its structure.  When just dumped as a blob of text, it is just difficult to see what it represents without any formatting.  Let's format the returned data to see its structure.

### Using Python's Minidom Library###

The large XML result that we get back and print out is just a string.  It has no special properties beyond that and if we want to parse it we would parse it as a string.  We could write our own parser to look at the XML content and try to print out its structure.  Thankfully, Python comes with a library that provides a Minimal DOM implementation or *Minidom* that has functionality to "pretty print" the XML or output the XML data in a more human-readable form.

1. To use this functionality, modify the **get-ap-xml.py** file and and insert this import statement on the second line:
```
import xml.dom.minidom
```
This line of code imports the Minidom library we would like to use.
<br/>
<br/>
2. Replace the line "print(responseString)" with the following:
```
dom = xml.dom.minidom.parseString(responseString)
xml = dom.toprettyxml()
print(xml)
```
In this snippet, we are:
	-  Parsing the Response as Document Object Model (DOM)
	-  Calling a method off of Minidom that returns a String as formatted XML
	-  Printing the formatted XML
<br/>
<br/>
3. Save the **get-ap-xml.py** file. If you want to just download or review the current code, you can get it from GitHub <a href="https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/coding-skills-sample-code/blob/master/coding201-parsing-xml/get-ap-xml-2.py" target="_blank">here</a>.
4. Execute your **get-ap-xml.py** file using Python:
```
python get-ap-xml.py
```
Note: You may need to run the python command as <b>python3.4 get-ap-xml.py</b> on OS X to force using the 3.4 version of Python.  If you get any errors, verify the version of python being executed and double-check the code.
<br/>
<br/>
It is still a formidable amount of text, but we can now see some of the structure of the XML document itself.

----------

A key thing to notice is that there is a hierarchical structure to the returned data.  Notably, the XML element with the Tag name 'Floor' has sub-objects and those sub-object can have objects themselves.  For this exercise, we are interested in the collection of Access Points for this floor and, in particular, the name, Ethernet MAC Address, and IP Address of each Access Point.  There is other information returned, but the **name**, **ethMacAddress**, and **ipAddress** attributes of an element with a Tag of **sAccessPoint** are what we are interested in.  

Structurally, the XML elements are represented in the following order:

&lt;Floor&gt;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;Dimension /&gt;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;Image /&gt;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;AccessPoint&gt;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;MapCoordinate /&gt;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;ApInterface /&gt;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;ApInterface /&gt;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/AccessPoint&gt;<br/>


In the above description, the elements tagged as AccessPoint have sub-elements of MapCoordinate and ApInterface.  The AccessPoint element itself has XML attributes that can tell us the name of the Access Point and its MAC and IP addresses.  A full AccessPoint element from the data can look like this:
```
<AccessPoint apMode="LOCAL" ethMacAddress="00:2b:01:00:05:f0" ipAddress="10.10.20.244" name="T1-4" numOfSlots="2" radioMacAddress="00:2b:01:00:05:00">
```
Where the Tag is "AccessPoint" and there are 6 Attributes: "apMode", "ethMacAddress", "ipAddress", "name", "numOfSlots", and "radioMacAddress".

If you are interested in looking over the complete reference of available map information from CMX, review the online documentation at [https://developer.cisco.com/site/cmx-mobility-services/documents/api-reference-manual/index.gsp#maps-api](https://developer.cisco.com/site/cmx-mobility-services/documents/api-reference-manual/index.gsp#maps-api "Online Documentation for CMX Maps API")

Now that we have a better understanding of what the structure looks like, let's parse the data.
