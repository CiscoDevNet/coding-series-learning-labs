## Step 2. Understanding the returned XML data

Before parsing the returned XML, take a moment to understand the structure and contents of the XML. It is difficult to see what an unformatted blob of text represents. So, the next step is to format the returned data so you can see its structure.

### Using Python's Minidom Library### 

The large XML result that the script returns is a string. Thankfully, Python comes with a library that provides a Minimal DOM implementation called *Minidom*. Mindom can "pretty print" XML in a more human-readable format.

1. To use this functionality, modify `get-ap-xml.py` and insert this import statement on the second line:
```
import xml.dom.minidom
```
This line of code imports the Minidom library.
<br/>
<br/>
2. Replace the `print(responseString)` line with the following:
```
dom = xml.dom.minidom.parseString(responseString)
xml = dom.toprettyxml()
print(xml)
```
This snippet:
	-  Parsing the Response as Document Object Model (DOM)
	-  Calling a method off of Minidom that returns a String as formatted XML
	-  Printing the formatted XML
<br/>
<br/>
3. Save the `get-ap-xml.py` file. To download or review the current code, you can get it from GitHub <a href="https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/coding-skills-sample-code/blob/master/coding201-parsing-xml/get-ap-xml-2.py" target="_blank">here</a>.

4. Run your `get-ap-xml.py` file using Python:
```
python get-ap-xml.py
```
Note: On OS X, to use Python 3.4, you may need to enter `python3.4 get-ap-xml.py`. If you get errors, verify the version of python and double-check the code.
<br/>
<br/>
The response is still a formidable amount of text, but you can see some of the structure of the XML document itself.

----------

A key point to notice is the hierarchical structure of the returned data. Notably, the XML element with the tag name `Floor` has sub-objects which can have objects. For this exercise, you are interested in the collection of Access Points for this floor and, in particular, the name, Ethernet MAC Address, and IP Address of each Access Point. In the information returned, you are interested in the `name`, `ethMacAddress`, and `ipAddress` attributes of elements that have an `sAccessPoint` tag.

Structurally, the XML elements have the following order:

&lt;Floor&gt;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;Dimension /&gt;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;Image /&gt;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;AccessPoint&gt;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;MapCoordinate /&gt;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;ApInterface /&gt;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;ApInterface /&gt;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/AccessPoint&gt;<br/>


In the description shown, the elements tagged as `AccessPoint` have sub-elements of `MapCoordinate` and `ApInterface`. The `AccessPoint` element has XML attributes that can tell you the name of the Access Point and its MAC and IP addresses. A full `AccessPoint` element from the data can look like this:
```
<AccessPoint apMode="LOCAL" ethMacAddress="00:2b:01:00:05:f0" ipAddress="10.10.20.244" name="T1-4" numOfSlots="2" radioMacAddress="00:2b:01:00:05:00">
```
Where the tag is "AccessPoint" and there are six attributes: `apMode`, `ethMacAddress`, `ipAddress`, `name`, `numOfSlots`, and `radioMacAddress`.

For a complete reference about map information from CMX, review the online documentation at [https://developer.cisco.com/site/cmx-mobility-services/documents/api-reference-manual/index.gsp# maps-api](https://developer.cisco.com/site/cmx-mobility-services/documents/api-reference-manual/index.gsp# maps-api "Online Documentation for CMX Maps API")

Now, you have a better understanding of what the structure looks like. Next, you'll parse the data.
