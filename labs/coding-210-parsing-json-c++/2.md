## Step 2: Adding cURL library support into the C++ application

### Adding support for getting HTTP

C and C++ do not come with a native library to access HTML content on the Internet using HTTP. However, you can add libraries that provide this capability. One of the more popular tools is cURL, a command-line utility for accessing web content. cURL also provides a library, `libcurl`, that you can use to simplify the complex task of asking for web content. The following instructions show you how to add support for libcurl to any application you are developing.

----------

To enable support for libcurl, complete the following steps.

1. Download the libcurl library.
##### On Windows using Cygwin
Cygwin enables you to add libcurl support by installing it through the Cygwin package support. This should already be set up on the DevNet Learning Lab for the Cygwin instance. However, you are doing this on your computer, make sure the libcurl libraries are installed.

2. Modify your code to include the Headers needed to use the functionality provided by libcurl.<br/>
To use the functionality provided by libcurl, include the programmatic definitions into your source code and use them as prescribed by the [cURL documentation](https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/). To simplify things even further, use the cURL "Easy" options for setting up a connection.

3. Change how you compile the application to include the required libraries.<br/>
Now that you've installed libcurl, you append the `-lcurl` flag to your compilation command.

----------

Now, now create a sample application that can reach out to the Internet.
1. Create a new file named `main-http.cpp`.
3. Save `main-http.cpp` to the `Coding210` folder on computer.
4. Within the text editor, add the following lines to `main-http.cpp`:

```
# Include <iostream>
# Include "curl/curl.h"
# Include "curl/easy.h"

using namespace std;

int main() {

	string uri = "https://www.cisco.com";

	CURLcode res;
	CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
    if(curl) {

        curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, uri.c_str());
        res = curl_easy_perform(curl);

        if(res != CURLE_OK)
        	cerr << "ERROR: " << curl_easy_strerror(res) << endl;
        else {
			// You should have received data from the URI
        }

        curl_easy_cleanup(curl);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This snippet:
-  Includes the `iostream` and `curl` headers required for using the standard input/output stream objects and curl\_easy\_* functions.
-  Declares that it is using the standard library namespace: `std`
-  Defines a `main()` function, which will be called by default.
-  Declares a URI that you want to get from the Internet.
-  Instantiates a curl object and calls `curl_easy_perform` to get data from the URI.
-  Cleans up the resources by calling `curl_easy_cleanup` on the curl object it initialized.

To download or review the current code, you can get it from Cisco DevNet GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/coding-skills-sample-code/blob/master/coding210-parsing-json-c++/main-http.cpp" target="_blank">main-http.cpp</a>.

Next, compile the file you created.
1. When your are in the local `Coding210` directory, in the command prompt window, enter the following command to compile your application:
```
g++ -o main-http main-http.cpp -lcurl
```
Notice that this is very similar to how you compiled in Step 1. The main difference is including a `-l` flag to indicate that you are including the cURL library.<br/><br/>
2. When you run the command, you should see a `main-http.exe` file in the directory. If there are any errors, correct them and retry the compilation.
3. If the compilation was successful, enter the following command to run your new executable:
```
./main-http.exe
```

If everything went according to plan, you should see HTML content output to the screen. This is a step closer your final goal and verifies that you can pull content from the Internet. Now, move on and add get some JSON content in the next step.

Proceed to Step 3: Getting JSON content.
