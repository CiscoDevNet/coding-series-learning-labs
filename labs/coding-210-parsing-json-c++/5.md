## Step 5: Extract specific fields from JSON

In the previous step you parsed and returned _all_ the JSON content using RapidJSON. In this step, you extract the pieces of information you are looking for: Access Point names.

----------

To get the Access Point names, modify your sample application to print out specific elements of the JSON you requested in the last step.
1. Create a new file named **main.cpp**.
3. Save **main.cpp** to the `Coding210` folder on computer.
4. Within the text editor add (copy & paste) the following lines to **main.cpp**:

```
# Include <iostream>
# Include <fstream>
# Include "curl/curl.h"
# Include "curl/easy.h"
# Include "rapidjson/document.h"
# Include "rapidjson/writer.h"
# Include "rapidjson/stringbuffer.h"

using namespace std;
using namespace rapidjson;

struct JSONDATA
{
    fstream *file;
    string *str;
};

size_t write_data(void *ptr, size_t size, size_t nmemb, JSONDATA *data) {

	size_t numBytes = size * nmemb;

    if (data->file)
        data->file->write((char*)ptr, numBytes);

    if (data->str)
        *(data->str) += std::string((char*)ptr, numBytes);

    return numBytes;
}

int main() {

    CURL *curl;
    CURLcode res;

    string uri = "https://msesandbox.cisco.com/api/contextaware/v1/maps/info/DevNetCampus/DevNetBuilding/DevNetZone";
    string header_authorization = "Authorization: Basic bGVhcm5pbmc6bGVhcm5pbmc=";
    string header_accept = "Accept: application/json";

    struct curl_slist *headers = NULL;
    headers = curl_slist_append(headers, header_authorization.c_str());
    headers = curl_slist_append(headers, header_accept.c_str());

    curl = curl_easy_init();

	fstream file("content.json", ios_base::out | ios_base::ate);
    string json;

    JSONDATA data;
	data.file = &file;
    data.str = &json;

    if(curl) {

        curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, uri.c_str());
		curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, headers);
		curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION, write_data);
		curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_WRITEDATA, &data);

        res = curl_easy_perform(curl);

        if(res != CURLE_OK)
        	cerr << "ERROR: " << curl_easy_strerror(res) << endl;
        else {

        	Document document;
            document.Parse(json.c_str());

            Value& accessPoint = document["Floor"]["AccessPoint"];
            assert(accessPoint.IsArray());

            // Iterate through the Access Points
	        for (SizeType i = 0; i < accessPoint.Size(); i++)
    		    printf("accessPoint: %s\n", accessPoint[i]["name"].GetString());
        }

        curl_easy_cleanup(curl);
    }

    return 0;
}
```
This snippet:
-  Doing everything you had done in the previous step
-  When the cURL call is successful, you attempt to parse the RapidJSON Document to get an Array of AccessPoint values from the Floor element

To download or review the current code, you can get it from Cisco DevNet GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/coding-skills-sample-code/blob/master/coding210-parsing-json-c++/main.cpp" target="_blank">main.cpp</a>.

To review the annotated version of the application that includes comments inline, you can get it from Cisco DevNet GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/coding-skills-sample-code/blob/master/coding210-parsing-json-c++/main-annotated.cpp" target="_blank">main-annotated.cpp</a>.

Next, compile the file you created.
1. When your are in the local `Coding210` directory, in the command prompt window, enter the following command to compile your application:
```
g++ -o get_aps main.cpp -Irapidjson/include -lcurl
```
Notice that you are changing the output application name to 'get_aps' by modifiying your compliation command and specifying what you would like to name the application.<br/>

3. When you run the command, you should see a `get_aps.exe` file in the directory. If there are any errors, correct them and retry the compilation.
3. If the compilation was successful, enter the following command to run your new executable:
```
./get_aps.exe
```

----------

When you run this application you should see a list of extracted Access Point names. With this approach, you could format or do further extraction based on the returned results.

Proceed to Step 6: Find additional resources.
