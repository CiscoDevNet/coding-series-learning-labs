## Step 4. Adding JSON library support into the C++ application

### Adding support for HTTP

As with native HTTP support, C and C++ do not come with a native library to parse JSON. Similar to cURL, there are libraries that you can add that functinality. The one that you use in this lab for parsing JSON content is called RapidJSON.

To add RapidJSON support, do the following:

1. Download the RapidJSON library
##### On Windows using Git
Because you do not have the RapidJSON library, it is a common task to pull it's headers and libraries into your environment using Git to get the code directly. You can download it from its Git repository at https://github.com/miloyip/rapidjson.git. From the command line while in your `Coding210` directory, run the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/miloyip/rapidjson.git
```
This command should download a new directory in your `Coding210` called 'rapidjson'.

2. Modify your code to include the headers needed to use the functionality provided by RapidJSON<br/>
By including several RapidJSON headers, you use several pieces of RapidJSON functionality by including Document, PrettyWriter, and StringBuffer headers.

3. Change how you compile the application to include the required libraries<br/>
To correctly include RapidJSON, add a compilation flag that includes the headers. You can do this by adding "-Irapidjson/include" to your compilation command.

----------

Now, modify your JSON sample application that can reach out to the Internet to return "pretty" version of the JSON you requested in the last step by parsing it and using RapidJSON's PrettyWriter to help output your content.
1. Create a new file named **main-json-lib.cpp**.
3. Save **main-json-lib.cpp** to the `Coding210` folder on computer.
4. Within the text editor add (copy & paste) the following lines to **main-json-lib.cpp**:

```
# Include <iostream>
# Include <fstream>
# Include "curl/curl.h"
# Include "curl/easy.h"
# Include "rapidjson/document.h"
# Include "rapidjson/prettywriter.h"
# Include "rapidjson/stringbuffer.h"

using namespace std;
using namespace rapidjson;

struct JSONDATA
{
    fstream *file;
    string *str;
};

size_t write_data(void *ptr, size_t size, size_t nmemb, JSONDATA *data) {

	size_t numBytes = size * nmemb;

    if (data->file)
        data->file->write((char*)ptr, numBytes);

    if (data->str)
        *(data->str) += std::string((char*)ptr, numBytes);

    return numBytes;
}

int main() {

    CURL *curl;
    CURLcode res;

    string uri = "https://msesandbox.cisco.com/api/contextaware/v1/maps/info/DevNetCampus/DevNetBuilding/DevNetZone";
    string header_authorization = "Authorization: Basic bGVhcm5pbmc6bGVhcm5pbmc=";
    string header_accept = "Accept: application/json";

    struct curl_slist *headers = NULL;
    headers = curl_slist_append(headers, header_authorization.c_str());
    headers = curl_slist_append(headers, header_accept.c_str());

    curl = curl_easy_init();

	fstream file("content.json", ios_base::out | ios_base::ate);
    string json;

    JSONDATA data;
	data.file = &file;
    data.str = &json;

    if(curl) {

        curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, uri.c_str());
		curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, headers);
		curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION, write_data);
		curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_WRITEDATA, &data);

        res = curl_easy_perform(curl);

        if(res != CURLE_OK)
        	cerr << "ERROR: " << curl_easy_strerror(res) << endl;
        else {

        	Document document;
            document.Parse(json.c_str());

			StringBuffer buffer;
			PrettyWriter<StringBuffer> writer(buffer);
			document.Accept(writer);

			cout << buffer.GetString() << endl;
        }

        curl_easy_cleanup(curl);
    }

    return 0;
}
```
This snippet:
-  Includes the previous headers, `fstream` header for saving to file, and the new RapidJSON headers to incorporate the functionality.
-  Declares that it uses the RapidJSON namespace: `rapidjson`.
-  Declares a `JSONDATA` struct to hold a reference to your file and string of JSON data.
-  Implements a callback function `write_data` to handle write operations from cURL.
-  The `CURLOPT_WRITEDATA` is set to the `JSONDATA` structure.
-  If everything went well, it uses `RapidJSON` to parse and prettify its JSON output.
-  Writes the JSON string to the ÃŸstandard output.

To download or review the current code, get it from Cisco DevNet GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/coding-skills-sample-code/blob/master/coding210-parsing-json-c++/main-json-lib.cpp" target="_blank">main-json-lib.cpp</a>.

Next, compile the file you created:
1. When your are in the local `Coding210` directory, in the command prompt window, enter the following command to compile your application:
```
g++ -o main-json-lib main-json-lib.cpp -Irapidjson/include -lcurl
```

3. When you run the command, you should see a `main-json-lib.exe` file in the directory. If there are any errors, correct them and retry the compilation.
3. If the compilation was successful, enter the following command to run your new executable:
```
./main-json-lib.exe
```

----------

If everything went according to plan, you should see properly indented JSON content output to the screen. Adiitionally, if you look at the `Coding210` folder, you see a `content.json` file. You can look at the content of this file with the following command:
```
cat content.json
```
This command displays the same JSON content you saw earlier in the standard output when you ran the application.

In the next step, you will learn how to specify the exact JSON content you want to extract.

### Next step

Proceed to Step 5: Extract specific fields from JSON.
