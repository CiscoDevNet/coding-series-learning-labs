## Step 3. Getting JSON Content ##

### Connecting to a JSON URI ###

In the previous step, you downloaded HTML content from the Internet. In this step, you would like to get JSON content instead. To do this, go to a URI that provides JSON content and also modify your request to accept JSON content from the server.

----------

Now, modify your sample application to get JSON content from the Internet.
1. Create a new file named `main-json.cpp`.
3. Save `main-json.cpp` to the `Coding210` folder on computer.
4. Within the text editor, add the following lines to `main-json.cpp`:

```
# Include <iostream>
# Include "curl/curl.h"
# Include "curl/easy.h"

using namespace std;

int main() {

    string uri = "https://msesandbox.cisco.com/api/contextaware/v1/maps/info/DevNetCampus/DevNetBuilding/DevNetZone";
    string header_authorization = "Authorization: Basic bGVhcm5pbmc6bGVhcm5pbmc=";
    string header_accept = "Accept: application/json";

	struct curl_slist *headers = NULL;
    headers = curl_slist_append(headers, header_authorization.c_str());
    headers = curl_slist_append(headers, header_accept.c_str());

	CURLcode res;
	CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
    if(curl) {

        curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, uri.c_str());
		curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, headers);
        res = curl_easy_perform(curl);

        if(res != CURLE_OK)
        	cerr << "ERROR: " << curl_easy_strerror(res) << endl;
        else {
			// You should have received data from the URI
        }

        curl_easy_cleanup(curl);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This snippet:
-  Does everything the snippet in Step 2 did, but goes to another CMX URI at msesandbox.cisco.com to get JSON content.
-  Adds an Authorization header that does "Basic" authorization with a Base64 encoded user:password of "learning:learning"
-  Adds an Accept header that is telling the server it would like to accept JSON content
-  Adds these headers into a curl_slist called 'headers'
-  Before calling `curl_easy_perform`, it sets the headers for the call using `curl_easy_setopt` with the `headers` passed in.

To download or review the current code, you can get it from Cisco DevNet GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/coding-skills-sample-code/blob/master/coding210-parsing-json-c++/main-json.cpp" target="_blank">main-json.cpp</a>.

Next, compile the file you created.
1. When your are in the local `Coding210` directory, in the command prompt window, enter the following command to compile your application:
```
g++ -o main-json main-json.cpp -lcurl
```
2. When you run the command, you should see a `main-http.exe` file in the `Coding210` directory. If there are any errors, correct them and retry the compilation.
3. If the compilation was successful, enter the following command to run your new executable:
```
./main-json.exe
```

----------

If everything went according to plan, you should see a blob of JSON content output to the screen. In the next step parse that returned content using a JSON libarary to make it a bit more human-readable.
