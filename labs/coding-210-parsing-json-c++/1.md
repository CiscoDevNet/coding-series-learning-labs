# Coding 210: Parsing JSON using C++

In this Learning Lab, you learn the basics of parsing JSON content using C++. You will use the [Connected Mobile Experiences (CMX) Mobility Services](https://developer.cisco.com/site/cmx-mobility-services/ "CMX Mobility Services") to query the names of available access points and put them into a simple list for display. To learn more about CMX, review the [Mobility Services Engine (MSE) Learning Lab](# /labs/cmx/step/1).


## Objectives

Completion Time: 20 minutes

* Create a basic C\+\+ application.
* Understand the basics of reading and parsing HTTP content using C\+\+.
* Save JSON content to file using C\+\+.
* Learn how to use C\+\+ to extract only the JSON data you want using the libcurl and the JSONcpp library.

## Prerequisites

* A text editor.
* For an introduction to retrieving results from a RESTful service, see the [Coding 101 lab](# /labs/coding-101-rest-basics/step/1 "Coding 101 Lab") .

##### On Windows #####
Install Cygwin with the gcc compiler and libcurl libraries.

You should also have a basic familiarity with JSON. Otherwise, consider visiting the [W3Schools JSON Tutorial](http://www.w3schools.com/json/ "W3Schools JSON Tutorial").

For this lab, use the GNU C Compiler (g\+\+) version 4.9.+ tailored for C\+\+. If you have g\+\+ already installed, verify your version entering the following command:
```
    g++ --version
```
If you are on a DevNet Learning Lab computer, the correct version of g\+\+ should already be installed.

## Step 1. Create an executable in C++

C and C++ are compiled languages. This means that you need to compile your program into object files and then link them into an executable file using a linker.

To get started, create a simple C++ file that outputs "Hello World!" to the command line.

1. Create a folder on the computer called `Coding210`.
2. Open a text editor and create a file named `hello.cpp`.
3. Save `hello.cpp` to the `Coding210` folder on computer.
4. Within the text editor, add the following lines to `hello.cpp`:

```
# Include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
	cout << "Hello World!" << endl;
}
```
This snippet:
-  Includes the `iostream` header required for using the standard input/output stream objects.
-  Declaring that it is using the standard library namespace: `std`
-  Defining a `main()` function which will be called by default.
-  Outputting the string "Hello World!" using `cout`, the standard output stream.

To download or review the current code, you can get it from Cisco DevNet GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/coding-skills-sample-code/blob/master/coding210-parsing-json-c++/hello.cpp" target="_blank">hello.cpp</a>.

Next, compile the file you created.
4. Save the `hello.cpp` file with the code added.
5. Open a Cygwin command prompt and navigate to the `Coding210` directory on the Desktop:
```
cd ~/Desktop/Coding210
```
6. When your are in the local `Coding210` directory, in the command prompt window, enter the following command to compile your application:
```
g++ -o hello hello.cpp
```
7. After you run the command, you should see a `hello.exe` file in the directory. You can list files and folders in your current directory by entering the following command:
```
ls
```
**If there are any errors, correct them and retry the compilation.**<br/><br/>
8. If the compilation was successful, enter the following command to run your new executable:
```
./hello.exe
```

----------

If everything went according to plan, you should see 'Hello World!' output to the screen. Compiling and running this basic application verifies that your software build toolchain is working. Now, move on and add more functionality in the next step.
