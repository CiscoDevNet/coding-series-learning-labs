## Step 3. Log to a file
Normally, you will want to save your logs to a file that can be opened and reviewed at any time.

Here is an example that logs to a file instead of to the console.

```python
# import logging module
import logging

# specify that we want to log to a file named mylog.log and that we want to track messages at the DEBUG level
logging.basicConfig(filename='mylog.log',level=logging.DEBUG)

logging.debug('This is a debug message.  We should see this in the file.')
logging.info('This is a debug message.  We should see this in the file.')
logging.warning('This is a debug message.  We should see this in the file.')
```
Let's look at what is going on in the code.

* First, we import the logging module - **import logging**
* In this statement, **logging.basicConfig(filename='mylog.log',level=logging.DEBUG)**, we specify the file that we want to log messages to, and we also set the logging level to DEBUG.

### Give it a try!

To run this code sample:
1. Open a text editor. 
    * *On a DevNet Learning Lab PC*, open Notepad++ (Start Menu -> Notepad++)
3. Create a folder for this lab.
    * *On a DevNet Learning Lab PC*, create a folder in "C:\Coding-101\yourname".
6. Copy/paste the code above into your new file.
7. Save the file with the extension **.py** in your new directory.  For example, **logging-step3.py**.
8. Open a command prompt.
    * *On a DevNet Learning Lab PC*, (Start --> Command Prompt)
9. At the command line, go to the directory where you saved the **logging-step3.py** file.
    * *On a DevNet Learning Lab PC*, **cd C:\Coding-101\yourname**
10. Type the python command and then the filename at the command prompt, and hit return.
    * *On Windows*, **py -3 logging-step3.py**
    * *On Mac OS or Linux*, **python3 logging-step3.py**
11. The program should execute or display an error message.

Now open the file **mylog.log**.  You should see a result like the following:

### Things to Try
* Experiment with using the different levels to log and display messages
* Try running the program multiple times.  Is the log file overwritten or appended to?
