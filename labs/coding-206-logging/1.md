# Coding 206: Using the logging module in Python

In this Learning Lab, you learn the basics of how to use the logging module.


## Objectives


* Understand how to use the logging module.
* Understand the different logging levels.
* Understand how to log to the console or to a file.
* Understand how to format the output of the logger.


## Prerequisites

**Python**
* To run the code samples, you need to have Python 3 installed on your computer.
* **If you are working on a DevNet Learning Lab computer at a DevNet event**, Python 3.x is already installed..
* See the previous **BYOD** section for information on how to install Python on your computer.


## Step 1: Understand the Python logging module 

While you are developing applications, it is important to be able to log messages and errors the app may generate. Python provides a good logging module that makes this easy to do.

Start coding with best practices right from the beginning and always use a logger in your applications.

Here is basic code that is required to log information to the console.

```python
# Import the logging module
import logging

logging.warning('This is a warning!') # This line will print a message to the console

```
If you run this code, it displays this output in the console:

Fairly simple, right?  Now, try it!

### Next step

Proceed to Step 2: Experiment with logging and logging levels.
