## Prerequisites
 
**Python**
* To run the code samples, you need to have Python 3 installed on your machine.
* **If you are working on a DevNet Learning Lab PC at a DevNet event**, Python 3.4.2 is already installed. 
* See **BYOD** section above for how to install Python on your own machine.
    

## Step 1. Introduction

Whenever you are creating an application, it is important to log messages about the progress of the application and details about any errors that may occur.

Python provides a really nice logging module that makes this easy to do.

Start coding with best practices right from the beginning and always use a logger in your applications.

Here is basic code that is required to log information to the console.

```python
# import the logging module
import logging

logging.warning('This is a warning!') # this line will print a message to the console

```
If you run this code, you will this output in the console:

Fairly simple, right?  Let's try it!
