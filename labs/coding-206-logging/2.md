## Step 2. Experiment with logging and logging levels
Here is code that performs simple logging to the console

```python
# Import the logging module
import logging

# Uncomment the following line to see both messages in the console
# Logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

logging.warning('This is a warning!') # This line will print a message to the console
logging.info('This is information') # This will not print anything because the default logging level is warning.
```

Now, look at what is going on in the code.

* First, import the logging module - `import logging`
* `logging.warning` logs a message with the level `warning`
* `logging.info` logs a message with the level `info`
* The default logging level in python is `warning`. If you use the default setting, then only the first message is displayed.
* If you uncomment and use the `logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)` statement, the logging level changes to `info`.
    * When the logging level is set to `info`, you see the second line in the console.

Here is some information on the different logging levels and how they should be used. (Taken from the python docs see [Python Docs](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html) for more info.)

* **DEBUG**	Detailed information, typically of interest only when diagnosing problems.
* **INFO**	Confirmation that things are working as expected.
* **WARNING**	An indication that something unexpected happened, or indicative of some problem in the near future (e.g., `disk space low`). The software is still working as expected.
* **ERROR**	Due to a more serious problem, the software has not been able to perform some function.
* **CRITICAL**	A serious error, indicating that the program itself may be unable to continue running.

The default level is **WARNING**, which means that only events of this level and higher will be tracked, unless the logging package is configured to do otherwise.

### Give it a try!

To run this code sample:
1. Open a text editor.
    * For example, *on a DevNet Learning Lab computer*, open Notepad++. (e.g., **Start > Notepad++**)
3. Create a folder for this lab.
    * For example, *on a DevNet Learning Lab computer*, create a folder in "C:\Coding-206\yourname".
6. Copy/paste the code shown into your new file.
7. Save the file with the extension `.py` in your new directory. For example, `simple-logging.py`.
8. Open a command prompt.
    * For example, *on a DevNet Learning Lab computer*, click **Start > Command Prompt**.
9. At the command line, go to the directory where you saved the `simple-logging.py` file.
    * For example, *on a DevNet Learning Lab computer*, enter: `cd C:\Coding-206\yourname`
10. At the command prompt, enter the `python` command followed by the filename.
    * On Windows, enter: `py -3 simple-logging.py`
    * On Mac OS or Linux, enter: `python3 simple-logging.py`
11. The program should run or display an error message.

With the logging level set to 'warning', you should see a result like this:

With the logging level set to 'info', you should see a result like this:

### Things to Try
* Experiment with the different levels to log and display messages.
