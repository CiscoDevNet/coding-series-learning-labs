## Step 2. Experiment with logging and logging levels
Here is the code to do some simple logging to the console

```python
# import the logging module
import logging

# uncomment the following line and you will see both messages in the console
# logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

logging.warning('This is a warning!') # this line will print a message to the console
logging.info('This is information') # this will not print anything because the default logging level is warning.

```
Let's look at what is going on in the code.

* First, we import the logging module - **import logging**
* **logging.warning** logs a message with the level 'warning'
* **logging.info** logs a message with the level info
* The default logging level in python is 'warning'. So if we use the default setting, then only the first message is displayed.
* If we uncomment and use the statement, **logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)**, then we change the logging level to info.
    * When the logging level is set to info, we do see the second line in the console.

Here is some information on the different logging levels and how they should be used. (Taken from the python docs see [Python Docs](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html) for more info.)

* **DEBUG**	Detailed information, typically of interest only when diagnosing problems.
* **INFO**	Confirmation that things are working as expected.
* **WARNING**	An indication that something unexpected happened, or indicative of some problem in the near future (e.g. ‘disk space low’). The software is still working as expected.
* **ERROR**	Due to a more serious problem, the software has not been able to perform some function.
* **CRITICAL**	A serious error, indicating that the program itself may be unable to continue running.

The default level is **WARNING**, which means that only events of this level and above will be tracked, unless the logging package is configured to do otherwise.

### Give it a try!

To run this code sample:
1. Open a text editor.
    * *On a DevNet Learning Lab PC*, open Notepad++ (Start Menu -> Notepad++)
3. Create a folder for this lab.
    * *On a DevNet Learning Lab PC*, create a folder in "C:\Coding-206\yourname".
6. Copy/paste the code above into your new file.
7. Save the file with the extension **.py** in your new directory.  For example, **simple-logging.py**.
8. Open a command prompt.
    * *On a DevNet Learning Lab PC*, (Start --> Command Prompt)
9. At the command line, go to the directory where you saved the **simple-logging.py** file.
    * *On a DevNet Learning Lab PC*, **cd C:\Coding-206\yourname**
10. Type the python command and then the filename at the command prompt, and hit return.
    * *On Windows*, **py -3 simple-logging.py**
    * *On Mac OS or Linux*, **python3 simple-logging.py**
11. The program should execute or display an error message.

With the logging level set to 'warning', you should see a result like this:

With the logging level set to 'info', you should see a result like this:

### Things to Try
* Experiment with using the different levels to log and display messages
