# Coding 202: Parsing JSON using Python #

In this Learning Lab you will learn the basics of parsing JSON content using Python.  We will use the [Connected Mobile Experiences (CMX) Mobility Services](https://developer.cisco.com/site/cmx-mobility-services/ "CMX Mobility Services") as a data source and query for the names of the available access points and put them into a simple list for display.  If you want to dig deeper into CMX, review the [Mobility Services Engine (MSE) Learning Lab](#/labs/cmx/step/1).


## Objectives ##

Completion Time: 15 minutes

* Understand the basics of reading and parsing HTTP content using Python
* Learn how to use Python to extract only the JSON data you want using the json library


## Prerequisites

You will want to make sure you have gone through the [Coding 101 lab](#/labs/coding-101-rest-basics/step/1 "Coding 101 Lab") if you are unfamiliar with Python and retrieving results from a RESTful service and the [Coding 201 lab](#/labs/coding-201-parsing-xml/step/1 "Coding 201 Parsing XML using Python Lab") for a similar approach to retrieving data using XML.


You should also have a basic familiarity with JSON.  If you do not, consider visiting the [W3Schools JSON Tutorial](http://www.w3schools.com/json/ "W3Schools JSON Tutorial") to get a firm base to build upon.

For this lab we will be using Python 3.4+.  To verify your version run the following command in a terminal window:
```
    python --version
```
If you are on a DevNet Zone station, the correct version of Python should already be installed.


## Step 1. Make a HTTP REST call with Python

To get started, let's create a simple Python script that can make a HTTP request to the CMX server.

1. Open the text editor and create a file named **get-ap-json.py**.
2. Save **get-ap-json.py** to the desktop.
3. Within the text editor add the following lines to **get-ap-json.py**:
```
from urllib.request import Request, urlopen
import ssl
req = Request('https://64.103.26.61/api/contextaware/v1/maps/info/DevNetCampus/DevNetBuilding/DevNetZone')
req.add_header('Authorization', 'Basic bGVhcm5pbmc6bGVhcm5pbmc==')
ctx = ssl.create_default_context()
ctx.check_hostname = False
ctx.verify_mode = ssl.CERT_NONE
response = urlopen(req, context=ctx)
responseString = response.read().decode("utf-8")
print(responseString)
response.close()
```
In this snippet, we are:
	-  Importing the required *Request* and *urlopen* libraries
	-  Constructing a request to the CMX URI
	-  Adding Basic authentication to our Request - the string of characters is the login/password encoded to Base64
	-  Opening the request and getting a Response back from the CMX URI
	-  Parsing the Response as a String and printing it out to the console

4. Save the **get-ap-json.py** file. If you want to just download or review the current code, you can get it from GitHub <a href="https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/coding-skills-sample-code/blob/master/coding202-parsing-json/get-ap-json-1.py" target="_blank">here</a>.
5. Open a command prompt.<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If your are using the Windows OS, type the following command into the command prompt window to move to your desktop:
```
cd %USERPROFILE%\Desktop
```
&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are using OS X, type the following command into the terminal window to move to your desktop:
```
cd ~/Desktop
```
6. In the command prompt window, type the following command to execute your newly created file using Python:
```
python get-ap-json.py
```
7. When you run the Python script, you should get an screen full of XML data returned to the terminal.

----------

Unfortunately, XML isn't the data format we wanted - but it is the data format CMX returns by default.  Let's ask CMX to give us back JSON data in the next step.
