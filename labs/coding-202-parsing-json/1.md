# Coding 202: Parsing JSON using Python

In this Learning Lab, you learn the basics of parsing JSON content using Python. You will use a Python script to query [Connected Mobile Experiences (CMX) Mobility Services](https://developer.cisco.com/site/cmx-mobility-services/ "CMX Mobility Services") as a data for the names of available access points and display them as a simple list. To learn more about CMX, review the [Mobility Services Engine (MSE) Learning Lab](lab/cmx/step/1).

## Objectives

Completion Time: 15 minutes

- Understand the basics of reading and parsing HTTP content using Python.
- Learn how to use Python to extract only the JSON data you want using the JSON library.

## Prerequisites

Go through the [Coding 101 lab](lab/coding-101-rest-basics-ga/step/1 "Coding 101 Lab") if you are unfamiliar with Python and retrieving results from a RESTful service and the [Coding 201 lab](lab/coding-201-parsing-xml/step/1 "Coding 201 Parsing XML using Python Lab") for a similar approach to retrieving data using XML.

You should also have a basic familiarity with JSON. Otherwise, consider visiting the [W3Schools JSON Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_intro.asp "W3Schools JSON Tutorial") to get a firm base to build upon.

For this lab, use Python 3.4+. To verify your version, enter the following command in a terminal:

```
    python --version
```

If you are on a DevNet Zone station, the correct version of Python should already be installed.

## Step 1\. Make an HTTP REST call with Python

To get started, create a simple Python script that can make an HTTP request to the CMX server.

1. Open a text editor and create a file named `get-ap-json.py`.
3. Add the following lines to `get-ap-json.py`:

  ```
  from urllib.request import Request, urlopen
  req = Request('https://cmxlocationsandbox.cisco.com/api/config/v1/maps/info/DevNetCampus/DevNetBuilding/DevNetZone')
  req.add_header('Authorization', 'Basic bGVhcm5pbmc6bGVhcm5pbmc=')
  response = urlopen(req)
  response_string = response.read().decode('utf-8')
  print(response_string)
  response.close()
  ```

  This snippet:

  - Imports the required `Request` and `urlopen` libraries.
  - Constructs a request to the CMX URI.
  - Adds basic authentication to the request.
  - Opens the request and gets a response from the CMX URI.
  - Parses the response as a string and prints it to the console.<br><br>

4. Save the `get-ap-json.py` file. To download or review the current code, you can get it from GitHub [here](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/coding-skills-sample-code/blob/master/coding202-parsing-json/get-ap-json-1.py).

5. Open a command prompt.<br>
  <br>
  For Windows, enter:

  ```
  cd %USERPROFILE%\Desktop
  ```

  For OS X, enter:

  ```
  cd ~/Desktop
  ```

6. In the command prompt window, enter:

  ```
  python get-ap-json.py
  ```

7. The command line/terminal displays the JSON data retrieved by the script.

This presentation of the JSON data isn't very useful. Next, clean up the presentation to get a better view of the structure and content of the data.
