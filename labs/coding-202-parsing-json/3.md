## Step 3. Using the JSON Python Library

### Using Python's JSON object ###

The large JSON result that we get back and print out is just a string.  It has no special properties beyond that and if we want to parse it we would parse it as a string.  However, Python comes with a standard library, *json*, that allows you to encode/decode and access JSON content in patterns familiar to Python developers.  When you load a string using the *json* decoder, it converts JSON objects into Python [dictionaries](https://docs.python.org/3.4/reference/expressions.html#dictionary-displays "Python Dictionaries") and JSON arrays into Python [lists](https://docs.python.org/3.4/reference/expressions.html#list-displays "Python Lists").  This is useful because it then allows us to access and iterate the JSON content like Python content.

Another useful tool of the json library is it's ability to "pretty print" the JSON output into a hierarchical structure to make it easier to see the overall structure of the data.  Let's use that to print the data into a more human-readable output.

1. Modify the **get-ap-json.py** file and and insert this import statement on the second line:
```
import json
```
This line loads the required *json* library.
<br/>
<br/>
2. Comment out the print(responseString) line by putting a pound or hash sign at the front of the line like the following:
```
#print(responseString)
```
We are commenting out this line because we are going to use the *json* library to pretty print our output.
<br/>
<br/>
3. Update the **get-ap-json.py** file and add the following line right after the commented out #print(responseString) line:
```
jsonObject = json.loads(responseString)
```
The json.loads() method loads the responseString as JSON.  If it is successful, you can now get a particular element from the jsonObject with the square brackets.  In short, this line loads the response string from the URI into a JSON object.  
<br/>
4. Next, add the following after the line you just added:
```
print(json.dumps(jsonObject, sort_keys=True, indent=4))
```
This line prints the dumps() method from the json library.  The arguments passed to the dumps() method control how the output is displayed.    
<br/>
5. Save the **get-ap-json.py** file. If you want to just download or review the current code, you can get it from GitHub <a href="https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/coding-skills-sample-code/blob/master/coding202-parsing-json/get-ap-json-3.py" target="_blank">here</a>.
6. Run the following command to execute your newly created file:
```
python get-ap-json.py
```
7. When you run the Python script, you should get JSON data returned to the terminal.

The returned data is now a bit more readable an allows us to see its structure. 

### Understanding the returned JSON data ###

Since we are asking for JSON data, the content we get back has a particular order or schema.  Elements of the returned 'Floor' JSON data have sub-object and even sub-arrays.  For this exercise, we are interested in the collection of Access Points for this floor and, in particular, the name, Ethernet MAC Address, and IP Address Address of each.  There is other information returned, but this brief hierarchy to the name and ipAddress elements shows what we are interested in.

Floor  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[AccessPoint]  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**name**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;radioMacAddress  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**ethMacAddress**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**ipAddress**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;numOfSlots  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;apMode  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MapCoordinate

In the above description, AccessPoint is an array of multiple AccessPoint instances - each with their own **name**, **ipAddress**, and other attributes.

Now that we have a little understanding of what the structure looks like, let's go to the next step and see how to get just the data we care about.
