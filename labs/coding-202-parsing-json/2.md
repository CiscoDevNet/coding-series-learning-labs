## Step 2. Getting JSON from CMX

### Asking for JSON instead of XML ###

We don't want XML returned from CMX, so let's ask it to return JSON instead.  We can accomplish this by telling CMX that we only want to accept JSON through the use of the "Accept" header in our request.  To make this happen, all we need to do is add an "application/json" media type to the "Accept" header.

1. Modify the **get-ap-json.py** file to include the following line immediately after the existing 'req.add_header' call adding the Authorization header:
```
req.add_header('Accept', 'application/json')
```
This line modifies our request to add a header stating that we want to accept a JSON result back from the server.  If we wanted to get XML back we could have left it our (it is the default return format) or we could have explicitly added an Accept header that stated 'application/xml' was what we wanted returned.

2. Save the **get-ap-json.py** file. If you want to just download or review the current code, you can get it from GitHub <a href="https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/coding-skills-sample-code/blob/master/coding202-parsing-json/get-ap-json-2.py" target="_blank">here</a>.
2. Run the following command to execute your **get-ap-json.py** file:
```
python get-ap-json.py
```
3. When you run the Python script, you should get an screen full of JSON data returned to the terminal.

----------

If we really look closely, the returned text is no longer XML but is now JSON.  So, by changing a header element on our call into CMX we can get the right format of data back.  Unfortunately, it is still a compact representation of the JSON and hard to read.  In the next step, let's take a look at the returned data and format it for readability.
