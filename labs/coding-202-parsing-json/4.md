## Step 4. Iterating through a JSON array in Python 

### Looping through a Python array

In the previous step, we decoded the JSON content into a *jsonObject* variable.  To loop through the Access Points within as an array, let's first get the Access Points using the *json* library and then use a Python *for* loop to go through each. 

1. Insert these three lines at the end of **get-ap-json.py** file but before the response.close() line.  Be sure to use 4 spaces on the second line as python is sensitive to indentation.
```
accessPoints = jsonObject['Floor']['AccessPoint']
for ap in accessPoints:
     print('Access Point: ' + ap['name'] + '\t eth: ' + ap['ethMacAddress'] + '\t ip: ' + ap['ipAddress'])
```
In this snippet, we are:
	-  Referencing the AccessPoints inside the JSON Object as a Dictionary using square brackets
	-  Loop through the accessPoints array printing out the information from each ap

2. Save the **get-ap-json.py** file. If you want to just download or review the current code, you can get it from GitHub <a href="https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/coding-skills-sample-code/blob/master/coding202-parsing-json/get-ap-json-4.py" target="_blank">here</a>.
3. Run the following command to execute your file.
```
python get-ap-json.py
```

4. When you run the Python script, at the end of the output you should get the JSON data values returned for each Access Point.

----------

This is a very direct way to use Python to get data from a REST service using JSON and parse out only the information we care about.  Depending upon the capabilities of the REST API, you can also sometimes pass in query parameters or other information to reduce the scope of returned data or search for a single or group of specific items.
