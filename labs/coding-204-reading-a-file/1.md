# Coding 204: Reading data from a file using Python

In this Learning Lab, you learn how to read data from a file using Python.

## Objectives

* Understand how to read data from a file.
* Understand the different modes that you can use when opening a file.
* Understand how to read JSON from a file.


## Prerequisites

**Python**
* To run the code samples, you need to have Python 3 installed on your computer.
* **If you are working on a DevNet Learning Lab computer at a DevNet event**, Python 3.x is already installed..
* See the previous **BYOD** section for information on how to install Python on your computer.


## Step 1: Understand how to read and display data from a text file

In the [Coding 203: Getting input from a user in Python](/lab/coding-203-getting-input/step/1) learning lab, you learned how to get input from the user with the keyboard.

Another common way to get input is to read data from a text file.

Python makes this operation easy.

Now, suppose that you have a file, **myfile.txt**, that contains the following code:

```text
This is the first line. Absolutely, the first line.
This is the second line. Yep, this is the second line.
```

To display this text, use the following statement.

```python   
# Opens the file and create an object called my_file_object that holds the reference to the file
my_file_object = open("my-file.txt", "r")

# read() reads in the entire file and prints it to the screen.
print (my_file_object.read())
```

Fairly simple, right?  Now, try some examples.

**Next step:**

Proceed to Step 2: Read the contents of a file and display to the screen.
