# Coding 204: Reading data from a file using Python#

In this Learning Lab you will learn how to read data from a file using Python.


## Objective ##

Completion Time: 15 minutes

* Understand how to read data from a file
* Understand the different modes that you can use when opening a file
* Understand how to read JSON from a file


## Prerequisites
 
**Python**
* To run the code samples, you need to have Python 3 installed on your machine.
* **If you are working on a DevNet Learning Lab PC at a DevNet event**, Python 3.4.2 is already installed. 
* See **BYOD** section above for how to install Python on your own machine.
    

## Step 1. Introduction

In the [Coding 203: Getting input from a user in Python](/#/labs/coding-203-getting-input/step/1) learning lab, we learned how to get input from the user using the keyboard.

Another common way to get input is to read data from a text file.

Python makes this operation really easy.

Let's say we have a text file called **myfile.txt**. and it contains the following

```python

This is the first line. Absolutely, the first line.
This is the second line. Yep, this is the second line.

```

We can read all of the data from this file and print it to the screen using the following statement.

```python   
# This line opens the file and creates an object called my_file_object that holds the reference to the file
my_file_object = open("my-file.txt", "r")

# read() reads in the entire file.  In this line of code, we read in the contents of the file and print it to the screen.
print (my_file_object.read())
```

Fairly simple, right?  Let's try some examples.
