## Step 5. Using 'with' to read a file
The best way to open and read from a file in Python is to use the [with](https://docs.python.org/3.4/reference/compound_stmts.html# with) statement.

The `with` statement wraps a block with methods defined by a context manager.

When you are opening files, `with` provides better exception handling and automatically closes the file.

Using `with` is definitely the best practice when working with files.

Here is an example:

```python
print ("Loop through and read each line using with to open the file")
x=1

# You can open the file using 'with'.
# 'with' provides better exception handling and closes the file
with open("my-file.txt") as file:
    for line in file:
        print ("Line " + str(x) + ": " + line)
        x += 1

```

Now, look at what is going on in the code.

* Open the file using `with open("my-file.txt") as file:`
    * The default mode is 'r' for Read, but you can still specify the mode as you did before.
    * The file object will be returned to the variable named `file`.
* You put the same `for` loop that was used in the previous step inside the `with` statement.
* You don't need a `.close()` statement because `with` closes the file.

### Give it a try!

To run this code sample:
1. Open a text editor.
    * For example, *on a DevNet Learning Lab computer*, open Notepad++. (e.g., **Start > Notepad++**)
2. Open your `read-file.py` file that you created in step 2.
3. Modify your code to use the statement and loop shown.
4. Save your file.
5. Open a command prompt.
    * For example, *on a DevNet Learning Lab computer*, click **Start > Command Prompt**.
6. At the command line, go to the directory where you saved the `read-file.py` file.
    * For example, *on a DevNet Learning Lab computer*, enter: `cd C:\Coding-204\yourname`
7. At the command prompt, enter the `python` command followed by the filename.
    * On Windows, enter: `py -3 read-file.py`
    * On Mac OS or Linux, enter: `python3 read-file.py`
8. The program should run or display an error message.

Using this text file:

```python
This is the first line. Absolutely, the first line.
This is the second line. Yep, this is the second line.

```

You should see a result like this:
