## Step 5. Using 'with' to read a file
The best way to open and read from a file in Python is to use the [with](https://docs.python.org/3.4/reference/compound_stmts.html#with) statement.

The **with** statement is used to wrap the execution of a block with methods defined by a context manager.

When you are opening files, this means that **with** gives you better exception handling and (bonus!) **with** will automatically close the file for you.

Using **with** is definitely the best practice when working with files.

Here's an example:

```python
print ("Loop through and read each line using with to open the file")
x=1

# you can open the file using 'with'.
# 'with' gives you better exception handling and when you use 'with' the file automatically be closed
with open("my-file.txt") as file:
    for line in file:
        print ("Line " + str(x) + ": " + line)
        x += 1

```

Let's look at what is going on in the code.

* Open the file using with **with open("my-file.txt") as file:**
    * The default mode is 'r' for Read, but you can still specify the mode just as we did before.
    * The file object will be returned into the variable **file**
* We put the same **for** loop that was used in the previous step inside the **with** statement.
* We don't need a **.close()** statement because **with** closes the file for us.

### Give it a try!

To run this code sample:
1. Open a text editor.
    * *On a DevNet Learning Lab PC*, open Notepad++ (Start Menu -> Notepad++)
2. Open your **read-file.py** file that you created in step 2.
3. Modify your code to use the with statement and loop above.
4. Save your file.
5. Open a command prompt.
    * *On a DevNet Learning Lab PC*, (Start --> Command Prompt)
6. At the command line, go to the directory where you saved the **read-file.py** file.
    * *On a DevNet Learning Lab PC*, **cd C:\Coding-204\yourname**
7. Type the python command and then the filename at the command prompt, and hit return.
    * *On Windows*, **py -3 read-file.py**
    * *On Mac OS or Linux*, **python3 read-file.py**
8. The program should execute or display an error message.

Using this text file:

```python
This is the first line. Absolutely, the first line.
This is the second line. Yep, this is the second line.

```

You should see a result like this:
