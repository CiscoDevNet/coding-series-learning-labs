## Step 2. Read the contents of a file and display to the screen
The following code opens **my-file.txt**, located in the same directory as this python file.

```python
# Use the open method to open a file
# Pass in the name of the file to open and mode. 'r' for read only 'w' if you want to write to the file
my_file_object = open("my-file.txt", "r")

print ("Read the whole file at once:")

# read() reads in the entire file. In this line of code, you read in the contents of the file and print it to the screen.
print (my_file_object.read())
print ("\n")

# .close closes the file object
my_file_object.close()

```
Now, look at what is going on in the code.

* `my_file_object = open("my-file.txt", "r")` opens the file in Read mode.
    * Pass the name of the file and the mode to the open method.
    * The "r" specifies that you want to open the file in Read mode because you only want to read from the file (use 'w' to write to file).
* `my_file_object.read()` reads in the entire contents of the file.
* `my_file_object.close()` closes the file when you are finished. (Don't forget to close the file!)


### Give it a try!

To run this code sample:
1. Create a folder for this lab. For example, *on a DevNet Learning Lab computer*, create a folder based on your name (e.g., "C:\Coding-204\&# 123;yourname&# 125;"). In a command window, you can enter `mkdir \Coding-204\&# 123;yourname&# 125;`.
2. Open a text editor such as Notepad++ (**Start Menu > Notepad++**).
3. Create a new file that contains some text and save it to your new folder as a `.txt` file  
5. Create a second new file.
6. Copy/paste the code shown into the file.
7. Save the file with the extension `.py` in the your new directory. For example, `read-file.py`.
8. Open a command prompt. For example, *on a DevNet Learning Lab computer*, click **Start > Command Prompt**.
9. At the command line, go to the directory where you saved the `read-file.py` file. For example,  *on a DevNet Learning Lab computer*, enter: `cd C:\Coding-204\&# 123;yourname&# 125;`
10. At the command prompt, enter the `python` command followed by the filename.
    * On Windows, enter: `py -3 read-file.py`
    * On Mac OS or Linux, enter: `python3 read-file.py`
11. The program should run or display an error message.

Using this text file:

```python
This is the first line. Absolutely, the first line.
This is the second line. Yep, this is the second line.

```

You should see a result like this:

### Things to Try
* What happens if you have a typo in the name of the file?
