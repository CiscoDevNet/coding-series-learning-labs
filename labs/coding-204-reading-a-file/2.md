## Step 2. Read the contents of a file and display to the screen
The following code opens a file named **my-file.txt** that is in the same directory as this python file.

```python
# Use the open method to open a file
# Pass in the name of the file to open and mode. 'r' for read only 'w' if you want to write to the file
my_file_object = open("my-file.txt", "r")

print ("Read the whole file at once:")

# read() reads in the entire file.  In this line of code, we read in the contents of the file and print it to the screen.
print (my_file_object.read())
print ("\n")

# .close closes the file object
my_file_object.close()

```
Let's look at what is going on in the code.

* **my_file_object = open("my-file.txt", "r")** opens the file in Read mode.
    * Pass the name of the file and the mode to the open method.
    * The "r" specifies that we want to open the file in Read mode because we only want to read from the file (use 'w' to write to file).
* **my_file_object.read()** reads in the entire contents of the file.
* **my_file_object.close()** closes the file when you are finished. (Don't forget to close the file!)


### Give it a try!

To run this code sample:
1. Open a text editor. 
    * *On a DevNet Learning Lab PC*, open Notepad++ (Start Menu -> Notepad++)
2. Create a new text file.
    * Enter some text.
3. Create a folder for this lab.
    * *On a DevNet Learning Lab PC*, create a folder in "C:\Coding-101\yourname"
4. Save your new text file in your folder.
5. Create another new text file.
6. Copy paste the code above into the file.
7. Save the file with the extension **.py** in the your new directory.  For example, **read-file.py**.
8. Open a command prompt.
    * *On a DevNet Learning Lab PC*, (Start --> Command Prompt)
9. At the command line, go to the directory where you saved the **read-file.py** file.
    * *On a DevNet Learning Lab PC*, **cd C:\Coding-101\yourname**
10. Type the python command and then the filename at the command prompt, and hit return.
    * *On Windows*, **py -3 read-file.py**
    * *On Mac OS or Linux*, **python3 read-file.py**
11. The program should execute or display an error message.

Using this text file:

```python
This is the first line. Absolutely, the first line.
This is the second line. Yep, this is the second line.

```

You should see a result like this:

### Things to Try
* What happens if you have a typo in the name of the file?
