## Step 4. Read the file one line at a time using a loop
Sometimes, it is useful to read the data from a file one line at a time and use a loop to keep repeating the operation until you have read the entire file.

You can use a file object and a `for` loop to move through the file.

```python
# You can also loop through the lines and read each line in a loop.
print ("Loop through and read each line")

my_file_object = open("my-file.txt", "r")
x=1
for line in my_file_object:
    print ("Line " + str(x) + ": " + line)
    x += 1

my_file_object.close()

```

Now, look at what is going on in the code.

* `my_file_object = open("my-file.txt", "r")` opens the file in Read mode.
    * Pass the name of the file and the mode to the open method.
    * The "r" specifies that you want to open the file in Read mode because you only want to read from the file (use 'w' to write to file).
* `for` each line in the file runs the code in the loop, prints the line, and increments the counter, `x`.
* `my_file_object.close()` closes the file when you are finished. (Don't forget to close the file!)

### Give it a try!

To run this code sample:
1. Open a text editor.
    * For example, *on a DevNet Learning Lab computer*, open Notepad++. (e.g., **Start > Notepad++**)
2. Open your `read-file.py` file that you created in step 2.
3. Modify your code to use the loop shown.
4. Save your file.
5. Open a command prompt.
    * For example, *on a DevNet Learning Lab computer*, click **Start > Command Prompt**.
6. At the command line, go to the directory where you saved the `read-file.py` file.
    * For example, *on a DevNet Learning Lab computer*, enter: `cd C:\Coding-204\yourname`
7. At the command prompt, enter the `python` command followed by the filename.
    * On Windows, enter: `py -3 read-file.py`
    * On Mac OS or Linux, enter: `python3 read-file.py`
8. The program should run or display an error message.

Using this text file:

```python
This is the first line. Absolutely, the first line.
This is the second line. Yep, this is the second line.

```

You should see a result like this:

### Things to Try
* Can you add some more code that runs inside the loop?
