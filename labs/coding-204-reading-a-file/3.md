## Step 3. Read one line at a time
Sometimes, it is useful to read the data from a file one line at a time.
 
We can use the **.readline()** method to read one line at a time.

Here is some code that reads only the first line of the text file.

```python
# .readline() reads in only 1 line of the file at a time.
print ("Read only the first line of the file:")
my_file_object = open("my-file.txt", "r")
print (my_file_object.readline())
print ("\n")
my_file_object.close()

```

Let's look at what is going on in the code.

* **my_file_object = open("my-file.txt", "r")** opens the file in Read mode.
    * Pass the name of the file and the mode to the open method.
    * The "r" specifies that we want to open the file in Read mode because we only want to read from the file (use 'w' to write to file).
* **my_file_object.readline()** reads in only the first line of the file.
* **my_file_object.close()** closes the file when you are finished. (Don't forget to close the file!)

### Give it a try!

To run this code sample:
1. Open a text editor. 
    * *On a DevNet Learning Lab PC*, open Notepad++ (Start Menu -> Notepad++)
2. Open your **read-file.py** file that you created in step 2.
3. Modify your code to use **.readline()** instead of **.read()**.
4. Save your file.
5. Open a command prompt.
    * *On a DevNet Learning Lab PC*, (Start --> Command Prompt)
6. At the command line, go to the directory where you saved the **read-file.py** file.
    * *On a DevNet Learning Lab PC*, **cd C:\Coding-101\yourname**
7. Type the python command and then the filename at the command prompt, and hit return.
    * *On Windows*, **py -3 read-file.py**
    * *On Mac OS or Linux*, **python3 read-file.py**
8. The program should execute or display an error message.

Using this text file:

```python
This is the first line. Absolutely, the first line.
This is the second line. Yep, this is the second line.

```

You should see a result like this:

### Things to Try
* What happens if you call **.readline()** multiple times?
