## Step 6. Read JSON from a file

If you are using REST APIs, see [Coding 101: Rest Basics Learning Lab](/lab/coding-101-rest-basics-ga/step/1) for more info. Often, load some JSON from a file.

You can use the same techniques that you used in the previous steps to help you read JSON from a file.

You are going to look at an example that reads some JSON that is returned by the [APIC-EM Controller API](https://developer.cisco.com/site/apic-em/).

The JSON contains a list of network devices that is returned by the APIC-EM APIs.

Here are the contents of the JSON file:

```json
{
  "response": [
    {
      "id": "d4b33d28-04dd-4733-a6de-8877ec26c196",
      "tag": "campus",
      "networkDeviceId": "e5f93514-3ae5-4109-8b52-b9fa876e1eae",
      "attributeInfo": {}
    },
    {
      "id": "d4b33d28-04dd-4733-a6de-8877ec26c196",
      "tag": "campus",
      "networkDeviceId": "da733ffb-e34b-4733-bd85-b615fb7e61f3",
      "attributeInfo": {}
    },
    {
      "id": "d4b33d28-04dd-4733-a6de-8877ec26c196",
      "tag": "campus",
      "networkDeviceId": "f8c3fc68-cd26-4576-bcec-51f9b578f71e",
      "attributeInfo": {}
    }
  ],
  "version": "0.0"
}

```

Here is the code you can use to load this JSON from the file and then display the network device IDs to the screen.

```python

# Import the JSON library. This library provides many handy features for formatting, displaying
# and manipulating json.
import json

# Use 'with" to open the file containing JSON
with open('my-json.json') as file:
    # read the whole file
    data = json.loads(file.read())

# Access values from the JSON and loop through devices and display the network device id
i = 0
for item in data["response"]:
    print ("Network Device ID: " + data["response"][i]["networkDeviceId"])
    i += 1

```

Now, look at what is going on in the code.

* The `import json` statement loads the JSON library.
* Use the `with open('my-json.json') as file:` to open the file containing the JSON.
* Use `file.read()` to read the entire contents of the file.
* Use `json.loads()` to load the contents of the file into a JSON object.
* Now, you have the contents of the file in memory in a JSON object and you can loop through and manipulate the JSON as usual.

See [Coding 202 Parsing JSON](/lab/coding-202-parsing-json/step/1) for more information on how to parse JSON.

### Give it a try!

To run this code sample:
1. Open a text editor.
    * For example, *on a DevNet Learning Lab computer*, open Notepad++. (e.g., **Start > Notepad++**)
2. Create a new text file.
    * Copy/paste the JSON shown into the file.
    * Be sure you do not add any leading or trailing spaces or blank lines.
3. Save your new text file in your folder.
4. Create another new text file.
5. Copy/paste the code shown into the file.
6. Save the file with the extension `.py` in the your new directory. For example, `read-json-file.py`.
7. Open a command prompt.
    * For example, *on a DevNet Learning Lab computer*, click **Start > Command Prompt**.
8. At the command line, go to the directory where you saved the `read-file-json.py` file.
    * For example, *on a DevNet Learning Lab computer*, enter: `cd C:\Coding-204\yourname`
9. At the command prompt, enter the `python` command followed by the filename.
    * On Windows, enter: `py -3 read-file-json.py`
    * On Mac OS or Linux, enter: `python3 read-file-json.py`
10. The program should run or display an error message.

Using the example JSON file shown:

You should see a result like this:

### Things to Try
* Can you display the tags for each device?
