# Coding 203: Getting input from a user in Python#

In this Learning Lab you will learn how to ask the user for data.


## Objective ##

Completion Time: 5 minutes

* Understand how to prompt a user to enter data
* Understand how to use the data entered by the user


## Prerequisites
 
**Python**
* To run the code samples, you need to have Python 3 installed on your machine.
* **If you are working on a DevNet Learning Lab PC at a DevNet event**, Python 3.4.2 is already installed. 
* See **BYOD** section above for how to install Python on your own machine.
    

## Step 1. Introduction

You often need to ask the user a question, and then use his/her answer to make decisions in an application.

Python makes this operation really easy.

For example, let's ask the user about his favorite vegetable.

We can ask him/her and then display the answer like this.

```python
# ask the user to enter his/her favorite vegetable
favorite_veg = input("What's your favorite vegetable? ")

# use the input to create a response
print("I like " + favorite_veg + " too!")

```
Fairly simple, right?  Let's try it!
