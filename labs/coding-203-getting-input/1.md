# Coding 203: Getting input from a user in Python# 

In this Learning Lab, you learn how to ask the user for data.


## Objective ## 

Completion Time: 5 minutes

* Understand how to prompt a user to enter data.
* Understand how to use the data entered by the user.


## Prerequisites

**Python**
* To run the code samples, you need to have Python 3 installed on your computer.
* **If you are working on a DevNet Learning Lab computer at a DevNet event**, Python 3.x is already installed..
* See the previous **BYOD** section for information on how to install Python on your computer.


## Step 1. Introduction

You often need to ask the user a question, and then use his/her answer to make decisions in an application.

Python makes this operation easy.

For example, ask the user about his favorite vegetable.

You can ask him/her and then display the answer like this.

```python
# ask the user to enter his/her favorite vegetable
favorite_veg = input("What's your favorite vegetable? ")

# Use the input to create a response
print("I like " + favorite_veg + " too!")

```
Fairly simple, right?  Now, you try it!
