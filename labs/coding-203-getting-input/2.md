## Step 2. Try it out!
Here is some example code that asks a user to enter his/her favorite vegetable, and then creates a response using the vegetable that was entered.

```python
favorite_veg = input("What's your favorite vegetable? ")
print("I like " + favorite_veg + " too!")

favorite_sauce = input("What is your favorite sauce? ")
print("I like " + favorite_veg + " with " + favorite_sauce + " on it!")

```
Let's look at what is going on in the code.

* The **input("What's your favorite vegetable? ")** statement asks the user the question and waits for the response.
* The response that the user types is stored in the variable **favorite_veg**.
* Then, we can use **favorite_veg** in our program the way we normally use variables.

### Give it a try!

To run this code sample:
1. Open a text editor. 
    * *On a DevNet Learning Lab PC*, open Notepad++ (Start Menu -> Notepad++)
3. Create a folder for this lab.
    * *On a DevNet Learning Lab PC*, create a folder in "C:\Coding-101\yourname".
6. Copy/paste the code above into your new file.
7. Save the file with the extension **.py** in your new directory.  For example, **get-user-input.py**.
8. Open a command prompt.
    * *On a DevNet Learning Lab PC*, (Start --> Command Prompt)
9. At the command line, go to the directory where you saved the **get-user-input.py** file.
    * *On a DevNet Learning Lab PC*, **cd C:\Coding-101\yourname**
10. Type the python command and then the filename at the command prompt, and hit return.
    * *On Windows*, **py -3 get-user-input.py**
    * *On Mac OS or Linux*, **python3 get-user-input.py**
11. The program should execute or display an error message.

You should see a result like this:

### Things to Try
* Try asking for some new inputs
* Try constructing some new responses based on the inputs
* Try using an [if](https://docs.python.org/3.4/reference/compound_stmts.html#if) statement to make your response vary based on the user's input.
