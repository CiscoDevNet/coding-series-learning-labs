## Step 8. Getting the Network Devices

Let's take a look at the Get Network Devices endpoint. A Network Device transports data to/from host devices or other network devices. A network device is typically a hub, switch or router and can be connected by an Ethernet cable or can have a wireless connection. Our goal here is to find the network devices and display information about them.

You can look at the details of the Get Network Device API from the [APIC-EM API Docs](http://devnetapic.cisco.com/).

1. Set up the API Call in Postman: Use the service ticket to authorize a request to GET the network devices from the controller.

2. To retrieve the list of network devices, enter the information in the appropriate Postman fields, as shown here:
	* **Method**
		* **A.** Select **GET**.
	* **URL**
		* **B.** Enter `http://{APIC-EMController}/api/v1/network-device` or, if you are not using your own APIC-EM Controller, enter the Always-On APIC-EM Lab controller`https[]()://devnetapi.cisco.com/sandbox/apic_em`.
	* **Headers**
		* **C.** Enter the `Content-Type` and value `application/json`.
		* `C.` Enter `X-Auth-Token` and the value of the service ticket created earlier.
	* **Authentication**
		* Is handled in the Headers.
	* **Body**
	 	* Not required for this request.
3. Click **Send**.
4. Postman sends the request to the server and displays the **Response Code**, `200 OK`, in **Status**.
	* You can see that **JSON** contains the list of hosts that was returned.

The output should look similar to the example. For display purposes, some records have been removed.

### Things to Try
* In Postman, append `/1/2` so the call becomes `http://{APIC-EMController}/api/v1/network-device/1/2` and click **Send**. How does the output differ?
* Compare the change you just made in *Get Network Devices API* call versus the change you made in the *Get Hosts* call in the previous exercise of Step 7. How are they different and why?  Hint:  Check the API Reference Guide for each of these API calls.
* In Postman, change the API call `http://{APIC-EMController}/api/v1/network-device/1/2` to `http://{APIC-EMController}/api/v1/user` and click **Send**. How is the returned data different and what does it represent?  Hint:  Check the API Reference Guide
