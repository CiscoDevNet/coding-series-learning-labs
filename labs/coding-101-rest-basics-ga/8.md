## Step 8. Getting the Network Devices

Now, look at the Get Network Devices endpoint. A Network Device transports data to/from host devices or other network devices. A network device is typically a hub, switch, or router. It can be connected to the network by an Ethernet cable or wireless connection. Your goal is to find the network devices and display information about them.

For details about the Get Network Device API, consult the [DNA Center API Docs](https://developer.cisco.com/site/apic-em-rest-api//).

1. Set up the API Call in Postman. Use the token to authorize a request to GET the network devices from the controller.

2. To retrieve the list of network devices, enter the information in the appropriate Postman fields, as shown here:
	* **Method**
		* **A.** Select **GET**.
	* **URL**
		* **B.** Enter `https://sandboxdnac/api/v1/network-device` or, if you are not using your DNA Center, enter the DNA Center Lab controller`https://sandboxdnac.cisco.com`.
	* **Headers**
		* **C.** Enter the `Content-Type` and value `application/json`.
		* **C.** Enter `X-Auth-Token` and the value of the token created earlier.
	* **Authentication**
		* Is handled in the Headers.
	* **Body**
	 	* Not required for this request.
3. Click **Send**.
4. Postman sends the request to the server and displays the **Response Code**, `200 OK`, in **Status**. **JSON** contains the list of hosts that was returned.

The output should look similar to the example in this screenshot. For display purposes, some records have been removed.

### Things to Try
* In Postman, append `/1/2` so the call becomes `https://sandboxdnac/api/v1/network-device/1/2` and click **Send**. How does the output differ?
* Compare the change you made in *Get Network Devices API* call with the change you made in the *Get Hosts* call in the previous exercise (Step 7). How are they different and why?  Hint:  Check the API Reference Guide for each of these API calls.
* In Postman, change the API call `https://sandboxdnac/api/v1/network-device/1/2` to `https://sandboxdnac/api/v1/user` and click **Send**. How is the returned data different and what does it represent?  Hint:  Check the API Reference Guide
