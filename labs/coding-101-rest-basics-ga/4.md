## Step 4: Construct a REST call

### DNA Center example: Create a token

Now, look at how to use the API to create a token for authentication.

You need to know how to construct the request to retrieve the token. Use the API docs to determine the:

* Method
* URL
* Headers
* Authentication
* Body

Get the description of the token API call from the [DNA Center API Docs](https://developer.cisco.com/site/dna-center-rest-api/). Choose the proper API version.

`POST /api/v1/token`: This method creates a new user token.

The HTTP call to a create a token is easy.
```

POST https://{DNA-Center-Server}/api/system/v1/auth/token

```

To get the token your request will look like this:

* **Method** - `POST`
* **URL** - `https://{DNA-Center-Server}/api/system/v1/auth/token`
	* Substitute `{DNA-Center-Server}` with the IP address or hostname of the DNA Center you are using. For example, the Cisco DevNet Learning Labs DNA Center is `https://sandboxdnac.cisco.com/`.
* **Headers**
	* Specify the 'Content-Type' as 'application/json'. It's typical to include this header with all HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) calls.
* **Authentication**
	* In this API call, the authentication data is passed in the body.
* **Body**
	 * Provide the username and password for logging into the DNA Center in JSON format.
