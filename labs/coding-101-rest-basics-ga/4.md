## Step 4. Constructing a REST Call

### APIC-EM Example: POST Create a Ticket

Now, look at how to use the API to create a service ticket for authentication.

You need to know how to construct the request to retrieve the service ticket. Use the API docs to determine the:

* Method
* URL
* Headers
* Authentication
* Body

All of the URLs for APIC-EM begin with:

```http

https://{APIC-EM-Server}/api/v1

```

Get the description of the ticket API call from the -- <a href="https://developer.cisco.com/site/apic-em/docs/api.html?version=1.6" target="_blank">APIC-EM API Docs</a>. Choose the proper API version.

`POST /api/v1/ticket`: This method creates a new user ticket


The HTTP call to a create a service ticket is easy.
```http

https://{APIC-EM-Server}/api/v1/ticket

```

To get the service ticket your request will look like this:

* **Method** - `POST`
* **URL** - `https://{APIC-EM-Server}/api/v1/ticket`
	* Substitute `{APIC-EM-Server}` with the IP address or hostname of the APIC-EM controller you are using. For example, the Cisco DevNet Learning Labs APIC-EM controller is `https://devnetapi.cisco.com/sandbox/apic_em`.
* **Headers**
	* Specify the 'Content-Type' as 'application/json'. It's typical to include this header with all HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) calls.
* **Authentication**
	* In this API call, the authentication data is passed in the body.
* **Body**
	 * Provide the username and password for logging into the APIC-EM Controller in JSON format.
