## Step 4. REST in Action: Now let's try it!

### APIC-EM Example: POST Create a Ticket

Let's take a deeper look at the how to use the APIs to create a ticket for authentication.

We need to know how to construct the request to retrieve the service ticket, so we need to use the API docs to determine the:

* Method
* URL
* Headers
* Authentication
* Body

All of the urls for APIC-EM begin with:

```http

https://{APIC-EM-Server}/api/v1

```

Let's look at the description of the ticket API call from the -- <a href="http://devnetapic.cisco.com" target="_blank">APIC-EM API Docs</a>.

`POST /api/v1/ticket`: This method is used to create a new user ticket


The HTTP call a create a service ticket is very easy.
```http

https://{APIC-EM-Server}/api/v1/ticket

```

To get the service ticket our request will look like this:

* **Method** - POST
* **URL** - ![https://{APIC-EM-Server}/api/v1/ticket]()
	* Substitute {APIC-EM-Server} in the address for the APIC-EM controller you are using
        * If you are not using your own APIC-EM controller, use the Always-On APIC-EM Lab: ![https://devnetapi.cisco.com/sandbox/apic_em]()
* **Headers**
	* For POST calls the 'Content-Type' must be specified as 'application/json' in the header.  It's typical to include this header for all REST method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE â€¦etc) calls.
* **Authentication**
	* In this API call the authentication data is passed in the body.
* **Body**
	 * The username and password used to log into the APIC-EM Controller must be provided in JSON format in the body.
