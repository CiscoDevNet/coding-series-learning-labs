# Coding 101 - REST API Basics #

In this Learning Lab you will learn the basics of consuming a REST API, and how to use POSTMAN to explore a REST API.


## Objective ##

Completion Time: 20 minutes

* Understand the basics of consuming REST APIs
* Learn how to use the POSTMAN REST Client to make API calls


## Prerequisites

In this lab, we are going to use <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop?hl=en" target="_blank">POSTMAN</a> which is a Google Chrome Browser application to make the REST API calls.

If you are on a DevNet Zone station, <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop?hl=en" target="_blank">POSTMAN</a> is already installed and can be launched either from the Google App Launcher or from Chrome by clicking <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop?hl=en" target="_blank">here</a> and hitting Launch App.

**Access to an APIC-EM Controller**
* To run these code samples, you will need access to an APIC-EM controller.
* **If you are not using your own APIC-EM controller**, you can use the  Always-On APIC-EM Lab: https[]()://devnetapi.cisco.com/sandbox/apic_em .
The login credentials for the always on sandbox are **username:** devnetuser and **password:** Cisco123!  More on this later.

## Step 1. Find the APIC-EM API Resources

We are going to use the APIC-EM API as an example of a REST API in this lab.  So before we begin, we need to locate the APIC-EM resources on DevNet.

1. In the browser navigate to <a href="https://developer.cisco.com" target="_blank">DevNet</a>
    * Click on the **Login** link located on the top right of the web page.

    * On the Log In web page enter your log in credentials (CCO ID) and click the **Log In** button
    ![](/posts/files/coding-101-rest-basics-ga/assets/images/register.png)<br/>
       * If you do not have a Cisco Connection Online ID (CCO ID) click the **Register Now** button and follow the instructions.  When done return to the Log In web page and enter your credentials.
<br/><br/>
2. Use the menu at the top to navigate directly to the APIC-EM developer resources.
   * Click on the **Technologies** link to access the Technology menu.  Inside the menu click on **Networking**  followed by **APIC-EM**<br/>

    <br/><br/>

3. You are now at the APIC-EM web portal.  Click on the `Docs` link.<br/>

4. At the APIC-EM Documentation web page open the API Reference doc in a separate tab while you are working on this lab.
