# Coding 101 - REST API Basics #

This Learning Lab explains the basics of using a REST API, and how to use POSTMAN to explore a REST API.

## Objective

* Understand REST APIs
* Learn how to use the POSTMAN application to make API calls


## Prerequisites

  - <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop?hl=en" target="_blank">POSTMAN</a> installed.
  If you are on a DevNet Zone station, <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop?hl=en" target="_blank">POSTMAN</a> is already installed. You can start it from the Google App Launcher or from Chrome by clicking <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop?hl=en" target="_blank">here</a> and clicking on **Launch App**.

  - Access to an APIC-EM Controller
    - To run the code samples, you will need access to an APIC-EM controller.
    - **If you are not using your own APIC-EM controller**, you can use the Always-On APIC-EM Lab: 
      * https://sandboxapicem.cisco.com
      * **username:** devnetuser 
      * **password:** Cisco123!

## Step 1. Find the APIC-EM API Resources

We are going to use the APIC-EM API as an example of a REST API. Locate the APIC-EM resources on DevNet.

1. In a browser, navigate to the <a href="https://developer.cisco.com" target="_blank">DevNet</a> home page.
2. Click the **Login** link located on the top right of the web page.

3. On the Log In page, enter your log in credentials.
   If you want to log in with a Cisco ID but do not have a Cisco Connection Online ID (CCO ID) click the **Register Now** button and follow the instructions. Then, return to the Log In web page and enter your credentials.

4. Use the menu at the top to navigate to the APIC-EM web portal.
   * Click the **Technologies** link to access the Technology menu. 
   * Click **Networking**
   * Click **APIC-EM**<br/>

6. On the APIC-EM Documentation web page open the API Reference documentation in a separate tab.  This will be a useful reference while you work on this lab.
