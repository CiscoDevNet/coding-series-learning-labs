# Coding 101: REST API Basics #

In this Learning Lab you will learn the basics of consuming a REST API, and how to use POSTMAN to explore a REST API.


## Objective ##

Completion Time: 20 minutes

* Understand the basics of consuming REST APIs
* Learn how to use the POSTMAN REST Client to make API calls


## Prerequisites

In this lab, we are going to use <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop?hl=en" target="_blank">POSTMAN</a> which is a Google Chrome Browser application to make the REST API calls.

If you are on a DevNet Zone station, <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop?hl=en" target="_blank">POSTMAN</a> is already installed and can be launched either from the Google App Launcher or from Chrome by clicking <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop?hl=en" target="_blank">here</a> and hitting Launch App.

**Access to an APIC-EM Controller**
* To run these code samples, you will need access to an APIC-EM controller.
* **If you are not using your own APIC-EM controller**, you can use the  Always-On APIC-EM Lab: [https://devnetapi.cisco.com/sandbox/apic_em](https://devnetapi.cisco.com/sandbox/apic_em).
The login credentials for the always on sandbox are **username:** devnetuser and **password:** Cisco123!

## Step 1. Find the APIC-EM API Resources

We are going to use the APIC-EM API as an example of a REST API in this lab.  So before we begin, we need to locate the APIC-EM resources on DevNet.

1. In the browser navigate to <a href="https://developer.cisco.com" target="_blank">DevNet</a>
    * If you have not yet created a DevNet userid click "Register" and follow the instructions.
    * After registering with DevNet, use your user id to login.

2. Use the menu at the top to navigate directly to the APIC-EM developer resources.<br/>

3. You will also want to open the API reference doc in a separate tab while you are working on this lab.<br/>
