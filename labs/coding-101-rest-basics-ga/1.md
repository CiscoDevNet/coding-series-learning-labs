# Coding 101 - REST API Basics with APIC-EM

This Learning Lab explains the basics of using a REST API. It also shows how to use Postman to explore a REST API.

## Objective

* Understand REST APIs
* Learn how to use the Postman application to make API calls

## Prerequisites

  - <a href="https://www.getpostman.com" target="_blank">Postman</a> installed.
  If you are on a DevNet Zone station, <a href="https://www.getpostman.com" target="_blank">Postman</a> is already installed. You can start it from the Google App Launcher or Chrome by clicking <a href="https://www.getpostman.com" target="_blank">here</a> and clicking **Launch App**.

  - Access to an APIC-EM Controller. To run the code samples, you need access to an APIC-EM controller. If you are not using your APIC-EM controller, you can use the APIC-EM Lab:
      * https://sandboxapicem.cisco.com
      * **username:** devnetuser
      * **password:** Cisco123!

## Step 1. Find the APIC-EM API Resources and Documentation

A good starting point to understand any API is to look at the documentation for the API. Now, find documentation for the APIC-EM API.

1. In a browser, navigate to the <a href="https://developer.cisco.com" target="_blank">DevNet</a> home page.
2. Click the **Login** link located at the top right of the webpage.

3. On the Log In page, enter your credentials.
   To log in with a Cisco ID but do not have a Cisco Connection Online ID (CCO ID) click the **Register Now** button and follow the instructions. Then, return to the Log In webpage and enter your credentials.
<br/><br/>
4. Use the menu at the top to navigate to the APIC-EM web portal.
   * Click the **Technologies** link to see the submenu.
   * Click **Networking**
   * From the list of technologies, click **APIC Enterprise Module (APIC-EM)**<br/>The APIC-EM webpage appears.
