## Step 2. So what is a REST web service?

### What is a Web Service?###

A web service is a way for two systems to communicate through a defined interface.
There are two major types of web services â€“ **REST** or **SOAP**.

### What is a *REST* Web Service? ###

REST is an architecture style for designing networked applications.
A REST web service is as easy to call as making an HTTP request.
RESTful interfaces often offer the CRUD (Create, Update, Delete) operations.

### What is so great about REST?  ###

***REST is easy to use on any platform***

### APIC-EM API is a REST API  ###

For this lab, we are going to use the <a href="https://developer.cisco.com/site/apic-em/" target="_blank">APIC-EM APIs</a>.

The Application Policy Infrastructure Control (APIC) Enterprise Module (EM),  Application Programming Interface (API), <a href="https://developer.cisco.com/site/apic-em/" target="_blank">APIC-EM APIs</a>, allows the deployment and execution of application policy across your networking infrastructure.

Using the APIC-EM APIs, we can retrieve information about devices on our network including a list of hosts, network devices, or users. We are going to use these features as examples to learn how to make REST calls from Python.

Take a look at the <a href="http://devnetapic.cisco.com/" target="_blank">APIC-EM Reference Docs</a> to see the details of all of the APIC-EM functions.


### How does this work?

REST is centered around the HTTP request and response model. Consuming an API is just as simple as making an HTTP request.

In this example, we request the list of hosts, and that information is returned to us in the response. The data returned in the response is usually formatted as json or xml.
