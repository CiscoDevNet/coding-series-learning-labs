## Step 3. What do I need to know to make a Request?

To construct a request, determine the following information for the API that you are calling. You can find this information in the API reference documentation.

- **Method**
Choose one of the following http methods:
	* GET - Retrieve data
	* POST - Create something new
	* PUT - Update data
	* DELETE - Delete data

- **URL**
	* Determine the URL of the endpoint you want to call.
	* Example: `http://{APIC-EMController}/api/v1/ticket`
	  * Where `{APIC-EMController}` is the controller IP or hostname.
    * Use the Cisco DevNet Learning Lab's APIC-EM controller, at https://sandboxapicem.cisco.com/, or enter the URL/IP address of an APIC-EM controller on your network.
- **URL Parameters**
    * If the endpoint requires URL parameters, pass them as part of the URL. To get this information, refer to the reference documentation for the particular endpoint.
- **Authentication**
	* Determine which authentication type to use. Basic HTTP, token-based, and OAuth are common types.
	* Add the authentication credentials to the API call you are preparing.
- **Custom Headers**
	* If required, add any HTTP Headers to the API call you are preparing. For example: `Content-Type: application/json`.
- **Request Body**
	* If required, include a JSON- or XML-formatted request body that contains any data that is needed.

### About Authentication

Authentication controls whether a user user can access a specific API endpoint and how they can access it. For example, one user might have read-only privileges, which they can only make API calls that read data. Another user might have read and change (add, edit, delete) privileges to every endpoint, which means they can make any API call. These access rights are typically-based upon assigned user roles such as *Administrator*, which grants a user full rights to change data, and *User*, which grants read-only access.

REST APIs have three common methods to authenticate users:

* **Basic HTTP:** The username and password are passed to the server as an encoded string. For more information, see [Basic Authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication).
* **OAuth:** Open standard for HTTP authentication and session management. Creates an access token associated with a specific user that also specifies the user rights. The token identifies the user and rights when making API calls to verify access and control. See [OAuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth) for more information.
3. **Token:** As with OAuth, a token is created and passed with each API call, but there is no session management and tracking of clients. This simplifies interaction between the server and client. APIC-EM uses this design for authentication management. See [Token Based Authentication](https://scotch.io/tutorials/the-ins-and-outs-of-token-based-authentication) for more information.

APIC-EM uses token-based authentication. So the first request you need to make creates a token. In  APIC-EM, this token is called a *service ticket*. The controller uses the service ticket to determine which endpoints you can access. The service ticket must be included in every API call except the one that creates the ticket.

The steps for using the APIC-EM authentication token are:

1. Create a ticket
2. A ticket (token) is returned in response body.
3. Include this token in the 'X-Auth-Token' header on all subsequent requests.

### Using the API Reference Documentation

The API Reference Documentation is where you can find the list of the API methods and the details for information on how to make each request. When you are starting to work with a new API,
the API Reference is one of the most important sources of information.

Study the Ticket API in APIC-EM:

* Open the <a href="http://devnetapic.cisco.com/" target="_blank">APIC-EM Reference Docs</a>. The entire API is presented in scrollable format.

* Click **Roll Based Access Control**, then scroll down to **ticket**.

    ![](/posts/files/coding-101-rest-basics-ga/assets/images/refguide2.png)

* Click **'POST' /ticket**. This endpoint provides functionality to create a ticket.
    ![](/posts/files/coding-101-rest-basics-ga/assets/images/refguide3.png)

* The API Reference includes attributes to be sent and returned. The Response portion defines the returned data, including HTTP status codes.

*  HTTP status codes indicate success, error, or other conditions. For more information, see  [http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/HTRESP.html](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/HTRESP.html)
	Some common codes are:
		* 200 OK
		* 202 Accepted/Processing
		* 401 Not Authorized


* Review the content to see what data is expected to be sent to the server and returned to your application. Both are circled here. In the example response for the Create Ticket request, you can see that the response string contains a `serviceTicket` attribute with a value of type string. This value is the authentication token you will need to make calls to all of the other API endpoints.

* In the Parameters section, click **Model Schema**. Double-clicking the box moves the parameters to an editable box to try out the function.

### Things to Try
* Look at the other ticket endpoints in the API Reference Guide. How do they differ from one another?
