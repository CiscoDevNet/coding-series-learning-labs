## Step 3. What do I need to know to make a Request?

To construct a request, you need to know the following information for the API that you are calling.  You can find this information in the API reference documentation.

- **Method**
	* GET - Retrieve data
	* POST - Create something new
	* PUT - Update data
	* DELETE - Delete data

- **URL**
	* The URL for the endpoint you want to call
	* Example: http://{APIC-EMController}/api/v1/ticket
        * *If you are not using your own APIC-EM controller*, use the Always-On APIC-EM Lab: https[]()://devnetapi.cisco.com/sandbox/apic_em .
- **URL Parameters**
    * The parameters that you can pass as part of the URL.
- **Authentication**
	* You need to know the authentication type to use. Basic HTTP, token based, and OAuth are common types.
	* Authentication credentials
- **Custom Headers**
	* Does the API require you to send any HTTP Headers?
	* Example: Content-Type: application/json
- **Request Body**
	* JSON or XML containing data that is needed to complete request can be sent in the body of the request

### A Little About Authentication

There are three common types of authentication for REST APIs.  Authentication is used to control access and access rights to the REST APIs.  For example, some users might have read only access which means that they can call only APIs that read the data. Other users might be allowed to both read and change the data (add, edit, delete) meaning that they can call any of the APIs. These access rights are typically based upon user assigned roles such as: Administrator where a user would have full rights to change the data and User where a user might have read only access.

1. **Basic HTTP:** The username and password are passed to the server in an encoded string.  See [Basic Authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication) for more information.
2. **OAuth:** Open standard for HTTP authentication and session management. Creates an access token associated to a specific user that also specifies the user rights.  The token is used to identify the user and rights when making APIs calls in order to verify access and control.  See [OAuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth) for more information.
3. **Token:** As with OAuth a token is created and passed with each API call, but there is no session management and tracking of clients which simplifies interaction between the server and client. APIC-EM uses this design for authentication management.  See [Token Based Authentication](https://scotch.io/tutorials/the-ins-and-outs-of-token-based-authentication) for more information.

APIC-EM uses token based authentication.  So the first request that we need to make is to create a token which in APIC-EM is called a service ticket.  This service ticket is used to both allow and control access to the APIs, and is required for all API calls other than the one made to create the ticket.

The steps for using the APIC-EM authentication token are:

1. Create a ticket
2. A ticket (token) is returned in response body.
3. Include this token in the ‘X-Auth-Token’ header on all subsequent requests.

### Using the API Reference Documentation ###

The API Reference Documentation is where you can find the list of all of the API methods and the details for how to make each request. When you are starting to work with a new API,
the API Reference is one of the most important sources of information.

Let's take a look at the Ticket API in APIC-EM.

* Open the <a href="http://devnetapic.cisco.com/" target="_blank">APIC-EM Reference Docs</a> The entire API is presented in scrollable format.

* Click on Roll Based Access Control, then click on ticket.

* On ticket click on 'POST' /ticket .  This API provides functionality to create a ticket.

### What is in the Response? ###

The API Reference includes information data attributes to be sent and returned.  The returned data is defined in the Response portion which includes the HTTP status codes along with the data format and attributes to be returned.

*  HTTP Status Codes
	* HTTP status codes are used to return success, error, or other statuses. <http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/HTRESP.html>
	* Some common examples are:
		* 200 OK
		* 202 Accepted/Processing
		* 401 Not Authorized


* Review the content to see what data is expected to be sent to the server and returned to your application.  Both are circled here.  In the example response for the Create Ticket request, we can see that the response string contains a "serviceTicket" attribute with a value of type string.  This is the token value that is needed to make api calls for all of the other API endpoints.

* In the Parameters section click on Model Schema.  Double clicking on the box moves the parameters to an editable box in order to try out the function.

### Things to Try
* Check out the other ticket APIs in the API Reference Guide.  How do they differ from one another?
