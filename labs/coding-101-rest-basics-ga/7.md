## Step 7. Getting the Network Hosts

1. Set up the API call in Postman.
	* Now, use the service ticket to authorize a request to GET the hosts from the controller.<br/><br/>

2. Enter the following information:
	* **Method**
		* `A.` Select **GET** in the Method drop down
	* **URL**
		* `B.` Enter **http://{APIC-EMController}/api/v1/host**
            * If you are not using your APIC-EM Controller, use the APIC-EM Lab: https://sandboxapicem.cisco.com.
	* **Headers**
		* `C.` Enter the 'Content-Type' and value 'application/json'
		* `C.` Enter the 'X-Auth-Token' and the service ticket created earlier. The 'X-Auth-Token' is required for all APIC-EM Controller API calls.
	* **Authentication**
		* Handled in the Headers
	* **Body**
	 	* not required for this request
3. Click **Send**. Postman sends the request to the server.

4. Review the response.
	* The **Response Code** in the **Status** field should be `200 OK`.
	* The **JSON** should display a list of hosts.

## Things to Try
1. In Postman, append '?limit=1&offset=1' to the URL http://{APIC-EMController}/api/v1/host so reads as 'http://{APIC-EMController}/api/v1/host?limit=1&offset=1'. Click the **Send** button. How does the return data differ?  Check the API Reference Guide for more information about the Get Host API call.
