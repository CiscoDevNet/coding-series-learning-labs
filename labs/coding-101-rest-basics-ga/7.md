## Step 7. Getting the Network Hosts

1. Setting up the API Call in Postman
	* Now, let's use the service ticket to authorize a request to GET the hosts from the controller.<br/><br/>

2. Enter the information as shown below for our request to retrieve the list of hosts into the appropriate Postman fields:
	* **Method**
		* `A.` Select **GET** in the Method drop down
	* **URL**
		* `B.` Enter **http://{APIC-EMController}/api/v1/host**
            * If you are not using your own APIC-EM Controller, use the Always-On APIC-EM Lab: https[]()://devnetapi.cisco.com/sandbox/apic_em.
	* **Headers**
		* `C.` Enter the 'Content-Type' and value 'application/json'
		* `C.` Enter the 'X-Auth-Token' and the service ticket created earlier.  The 'X-Auth-Token' is required for all APIC-EM Controller API calls.
	* **Authentication**
		* Handled in the Headers
	* **Body**
	 	* not required for this request
3. Click **Send**.
4. Postman will send the request to the server, and the display the response.
	* You can see the **Response Code** that is returned specified in the **Status** field as '200 OK'.
	* You can see the **JSON** that contains the list of hosts that is returned.

## Things to Try
1. In Postman append '?limit=1&offset=1' to the URL http://{APIC-EMController}/api/v1/host so reads as 'http://{APIC-EMController}/api/v1/host?limit=1&offset=1'.  Press the Send button.  How does the return data differ?  Check the API Reference Guide for more information about the Get Host API call.
