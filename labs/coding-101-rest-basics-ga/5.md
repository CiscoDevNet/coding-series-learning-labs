## Step 5. Make a REST API Call

There are many HTTP clients that can help you quickly test web services. These types of tools provide an easy way to construct and send requests to REST APIs, and to view the responses.  

* Postman - [http://www.getpostman.com/](http://www.getpostman.com/)
* Firefox RestClient - [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/restclient/](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/restclient/)
* Command Line using curl  - [http://curl.haxx.se/docs/httpscripting.html#POST](http://curl.haxx.se/docs/httpscripting.html#POST)
* SOAPUI
* Many IDEs have consoles for testing REST Services built in

In this lab, we use Postman as an example of a REST client.

**Accept the SSL certificate before you begin**
You may need to accept the SSL certificate before calling the APIs in Postman. If you see a certificate warning when visiting the sandbox, then follow these steps. If you do not see a warning, skip these steps.

1. Open Chrome.

2. If you are using the DevNet Always-On APIC-EM Sandbox, go to [https://sandboxapic.cisco.com](https://sandboxapic.cisco.com).

3. If you receive a message specifying that there's a certificate issue, click the **Advanced** link. Otherwise, if you are taken to the APIC-EM UI login screen skip to the 'Using Postman to make REST API Calls' section.<br/><br/>

4. Click the **Proceed to &lt;your IP>** link<br/><br/>
![](/posts/files/coding-101-rest-basics-ga/assets/images/ssl2.png)<br/>

5. You should then be taken the APIC-EM login screen. Now you are ready to start working in Postman.<br/><br/>

**Using Postman to make REST API Calls**
1. Start Chrome and open Postman.
	* If you are on a DevNet Zone station, Postman is already installed and can be launched either from the Google App Launcher or Chrome by clicking <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop?hl=en" target="_blank">POSTMAN</a> and hitting Launch App. Otherwise, make sure that you are viewing this page in the Chrome browser, click the POSTMAN link specified above and follow the instructions to install and launch Postman.

2. Enter the information as shown below for our request to retrieve the list of hosts into the appropriate Postman fields:

   ![](/posts/files/coding-101-rest-basics-ga/assets/images/postman1.png)

	* **Method**
		* ``A.``  Select **POST**.
	* **URL**
		* ``B.`` Enter **http://{APIC-EMController}/api/v1/ticket**
			* If you are not using your APIC-EM controller, use the Always-On APIC-EM Lab: https[]()://devnetapi.cisco.com/sandbox/apic_em .
	* **Body**
		* ``C.`` Enter the username and password in JSON format. These credentials are used to log into the APIC-EM Controller. If you are accessing the DevNet APIC-EM Always-On Lab, enter the username and password specified above. Otherwise, enter the required username and password for your APIC-EM Controller.
	* **Headers**
		* ``A.`` In the header, enter 'Content-Type'  followed by 'application/json'.<br/><br/>

	* **Authentication**
		* Authentication is entered via the Body as specified above.
3. Click **Send**.
4. Postman sends the request to the server and displays the response.
	* The **Response Code**, '200', appears in the **Status** field.
	* The **JSON** response contains a **serviceTicket** attribute. We've highlighted an example service ticket value. The actual value will be different. **Copy and paste this value into a text file to use for the next steps!**<br/><br/>
