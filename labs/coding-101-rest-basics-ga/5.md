## Step 5. Make a REST API Call

There are HTTP clients you can use to quickly test web services. They provide a way to construct/send requests to REST APIs and view the responses:

* Postman - [https://www.getpostman.com/](https://www.getpostman.com/)
* Firefox RestClient - [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/restclient/](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/restclient/)
* Command Line using curl  - [https://curl.haxx.se/docs/httpscripting.html# POST](https://curl.haxx.se/docs/httpscripting.html# POST)
* SOAPUI - [https://www.soapui.org/](https://www.soapui.org/)

Many IDEs have also consoles for testing REST Services built in.

In this lab, you use Postman as an example of a REST client.

### Accept the SSL certificate before you begin
On OS X, to use Python 3.4, you may need to accept the SSL certificate before calling the APIs in Postman. If you see a certificate warning when visiting the sandbox, then follow these steps. Otherwise, skip these steps.

1. Open Chrome.

2. If you are using the DevNet DNA Center Platform Sandbox, go to [https://sandboxdnac.cisco.com](https://sandboxdnac.cisco.com).

3. If you receive a message specifying that there is a certificate issue, click the **Advanced** link. Otherwise, if you are taken to the login screen skip to the 'Using Postman to make REST API Calls' section.

4. Click the **Proceed to &lt;your IP>** link.

5. You should then be taken the login screen. Now you are ready to start working in Postman.<br/><br/>

### Using Postman to make REST API Calls

1. Start Chrome and open Postman. If you are on a DevNet Zone station, Postman is already installed.

2. For your request to retrieve the list of hosts into the appropriate Postman fields, enter the following information:

   ![](/posts/files/coding-101-rest-basics-ga/assets/images/postman1.png)

	* **Method**
		* ``A.``  Select **POST**.
	* **URL**
		* ``B.`` Enter `https://sandboxdnac.cisco.com/api/system/v1/auth/token` to use the DevNet Sandbox, or enter your own API endpoint.
	* **Body**
		* ``C.`` Enter the username and password in JSON format. These credentials are used to log into the DNA Center. If you are accessing the DNA Center Platform Sandbox, enter the username and password, as specified earlier. Otherwise, enter the required username and password for your DNA Center.
	* **Headers**
		* ``A.`` In the header, enter: `Content-Type`  followed by `application/json`.<br/><br/>

	* **Authentication**
		* Authentication is entered using the Body, as specified earlier.
3. Click **Send**.
4. Postman sends the request to the server and displays the response.
	* The **Response Code**, `200`, appears in the **Status** field.
	* The **JSON** response contains a **token** attribute. You've highlighted an example token value. The actual value will be different. **Copy and paste this value into a text file to use for the next steps!**

#### Congratulations! You made your first REST API call!

### Next Step: Hosts API URL
