## Step 6. Using the Service Ticket to Make APIC-EM REST API Calls

### APIC-EM Example: Get Hosts

Now, look at the Get Hosts endpoint. A host is an end device attached to the network, such as a computer connected to a wireless device. Your goal is to find the hosts and display information about them.

To construct a request that retrieves a list of hosts, refer to the <a href="http://devnetapic.cisco.com/" target="_blank">APIC-EM API Docs</a>. Click on Inventory under Services to find Get /host. These provide the following information:

* Method
* URL
* Headers
* Authentication
* Body

As specified earlier, you can see that the base URL for APIC-EM is:

```http

https://{APIC-EM-Server}/api/v1

```

The following call retrieves all of hosts on the specified server
```http

GET https://{APIC-EM-Server}/api/v1/host

```

Alternatively, you may want to retrieve some of the hosts to page through them. In that case, pass the 'limit' parameter to specify the maximum number of hosts to be returned. You can also pass the 'offset' parameter to specify where to start the list of hosts. The following call specifies to start from the first host, (offset=1), and to return a maximum of five hosts, (limit=5).
```http

GET https://{APIC-EM-Server}/api/v1/host?limit=5&offset=1

```

To get the entire list of hosts, your request will be like this:

* **Method** - `GET`
* **URL** - `https://{APIC-EM-Server}/api/v1/host`
	* Insert the IP address or hostname of the APIC-EM controller.
* **Headers**
	* For authentication, add the service ticket that was created earlier. On the left side of the header, add the text 'X-Auth-Token'. On the right side, add the service ticket value.
	* When using GET, a content header is not required. However, it's a good practice to specify the content in the header anyway as  'Content-Type' 'application/json'
* **Authentication**
	* Handled in the header.
* **Body**
	 * Not required for this request
