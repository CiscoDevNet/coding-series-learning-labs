## Step 6. Using the Service Ticket to Make APIC-EM REST API Calls

### APIC-EM Example: Get Hosts

Let's take a look at the Get Hosts REST API call.  A host is an end device such as a workstation that is attached to a network device such as a switch via a network cable or wireless device.  Our goal here is to find the hosts and display information about them.

We need to know how to construct the request to retrieve the list of Hosts.  So we need to use the API docs to determine the:

* Method
* URL
* Headers
* Authentication
* Body

As specified earlier from the API EM docs, we can see that all of the urls for API-EM begin with:

```http

https://{APIC-EM-Server}/api/v1

```

You can look at the details of the Get Hosts API from the -- <a href="http://devnetapic.cisco.com/" target="_blank">APIC-EM API Docs</a>.

The call below retrieves all hosts on the specified server
```http

GET https://{APIC-EM-Server}/api/v1/host

```

Alternatively, for display purposes you may want to retrieve just some of the hosts in order to page through them.  For example, we can pass the parameter 'limit' to specify the maximum amount of hosts that we want returned. If desired, we can also pass the parameter 'offset' to specify where to start in the list of hosts. The call below specifies to start from the first host, (offset=1), and that a maximum of five hosts, (limit=5), should be returned.
```http

GET https://{APIC-EM-Server}/api/v1/host?limit=5&offset=1

```

To get the entire list of Hosts, our request will be like this:

* **Method** - GET
* **URL** - https://{APIC-EM-Server}/api/v1/host
	* substitute in address for the APIC-EM controller you are using
        * If you are not using your own APIC-EM Controller, use the [DevNet Sandbox](https://developer.cisco.com/site/devnet/sandbox/) Always-On APIC-EM Lab: [https://sandboxapic.cisco.com](https://sandboxapic.cisco.com).
* **Headers**
	* For Authentication purposes we need to add the service ticket that was created earlier.  On the left side of the header we add the text 'X-Auth-Token'.  On the right side we add the service ticket value that was returned by calling the Create Ticket endpoint.
	* When using GET a header for the content is not required for this request, but in practice it's good to specify the content in the header anyway as 'Content-Type' 'application/json'
* **Authentication**
	* Handled in the header specified above.
* **Body**
	 * Not required for this request
