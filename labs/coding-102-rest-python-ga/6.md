# Step 6. Build Network Topology and Graphical Display

In this step, you get the network topology data. Then, you use Cisco [NeXt UI](https://developer.cisco.com/site/neXt/) to parse the data and display the topology graphically. You'll also use a web server tool called [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) to interface with NeXt UI. Flask is a Python module.

Here is high level view and flowchart of this process.
1. You run `build-topology-web-server.py`, which starts Flask and its web server.
2. Flask calls the `index()` function in `build-topology-web-server.py`, which sets off a chain of events.
3. The `index()` function loads `topology.html`, which contains JavaScript that uses the NeXt UI toolkit libraries.
4. NeXt calls `topology()` in `build-topology-web-server.py` to get the topology data in JSON format.
5. NeXt parses and renders the network topology from the data.

Now study the source code. Focus on the python script.

#### build-topology-web-server.py
This sample code starts the Flask web application and provides functions that are called to retrieve a list of devices, called *nodes*, and the links that connect them. This script, along with Flask and NeXt UI, read the network topology and graphically display it as a webpage.


```python
# Import requests library
import requests

# Import json library
import json

# Import flask web framework
from flask import Flask

# From flask, import render_template function
from flask import render_template, jsonify

controller = 'devnetapi.cisco.com/sandbox/apic_em'


def getTicket():
    # Put the IP address or DNS of your APIC-EM controller in this URL
    url = "https://" + controller + "/api/v1/ticket"

    # The username and password to access the APIC-EM Controller
    payload = {"username": "devnetuser", "password": "Cisco123!"}

    # Content type must be included in the header
    header = {"content-type": "application/json"}

    # Perform a POST on the specified url to get the service ticket
    response = requests.post(url, data=json.dumps(payload), headers=header, verify=False)

    print(response)

    # Convert response to JSON format
    r_json = response.json()

    # Parse the JSON to get the service ticket
    ticket = r_json["response"]["serviceTicket"]

    return ticket


def getTopology(ticket):
    # URL for network device REST API call to get list of exisiting devices on the network.
    url = "https://" + controller + "/api/v1/topology/physical-topology"

    # Include the content type and ticket in the header
    header = {"content-type": "application/json", "X-Auth-Token": ticket}

    # This statement performs a GET on the specified network device url
    response = requests.get(url, headers=header, verify=False)

    # Convert data to JSON format.
    r_json = response.json()

    # Return json object
    return r_json["response"]


# Intialize a web app
app = Flask(__name__)


# Define index route to return topology.html
@app.route("/")
def index():
    # when called '/' which is the default index page, render the template 'topology.html'
    return render_template("topology.html")


# Define an reset api to get topology data
@app.route("/api/topology")
def topology():
    # Get ticket
    theTicket = getTicket()

    # Get topology data and return `jsonify` string to request
    return jsonify(getTopology(theTicket))


if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()
```

Now, look at what the code is doing. Focus on the key code changes.
* `from flask import Flask`
    * From the flask python module imports the Flask object
* `from flask import render_template, jsonify`
    * From the flask python module imports a couple of functions which are `render_template` and `jsonify`.
* `app = Flask(__name__)`
    * Instanitates the Flask web application.
* `@app.route("/")`
    * Tags the following function it "def index()" and specifies that it is called as the default webpage for the Flask web application variable `app`.
* `def index():`
    * The index function that calls the Flask function `render_template` that loads the `topology.html` webpage.
* `@app.route("/api/topology")`
    * Tags the following function it "def topology()" and is called by NeXt UI. Identifies as webpage for the Flask web application variable 'app'
* `def topology():`
    * Returns the network topology data in JSON format.
* `if __name__ == "__main__":`
    * Optional code that specifies that if this module is run, rather than importing it and calling its functions, that this is the point where the script should begin running. Python typically already has this information, but this prevents any ambiguity.
* `app.run()`
    * Starts the Flask web application.


To run this code sample:
1. In a terminal, enter:
    `cd \DevNetCode\~your-name~\coding-skills-sample-code\coding102-REST-python-ga`
2. Assign the APIC-EM Controller IP address or DNS to the `controller` variable.
    * Open the file `build-topology-web-server.py`. For example, in Windows, enter: `notepad build-topology-web-server.py`
    * *If you are not using your APIC-EM Controller*, use the [DevNet Sandbox](https://developer.cisco.com/site/devnet/sandbox/) APIC-EM Lab: https://sandboxapicem.cisco.com
        * controller='sandboxapicem.cisco.com'
3. Save the file. If encoding type is an option, select `UTF-8`.
4. At the command prompt, enter the `python` command followed by the filename.
    * On Windows, enter: `py -3 build-topology-web-server.py` or `python build-topology-web-server.py`
    * On Mac OS or Linux, enter: `python3 build-topology-web-server.py`
5. The Flask web server will start listening at IP 127.0.0.1 port 5000. If the error: *"ImportError: No module named 'flask'"* is given, click the *"How to Set up Your Computer"* link at the top of this webpage.

6. Open a web browser such as Chrome or Safari and, in the URL field, enter  **http://127.0.0.1:5000**. You should see a result like the following example.

## Things to Try
* Compare the first three layers of the topology to what you drew in step 5. Do they match?
* Go to the templates directory and open the file `topology.html`. In the JavaScript block identified within block * &lt; script type=text/javascript &gt; * change the width and height from 800 to 400. Rerun the program. What's changed?
