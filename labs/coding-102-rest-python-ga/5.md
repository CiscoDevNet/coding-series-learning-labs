# Step 5. Build Network Topology

In this step we're going to get the topology then parse the data to determine and display how devices link to one another and their link status.


#### build-topology.py
This sample code uses the application REST function call to retrieve a list of devices called nodes and links which are the interfaces that connect them. Our goal is to find the devices and display information about them and how they connect to other devices.


```python
# import requests library
import requests

#import json library
import json

# Disable warnings
requests.packages.urllib3.disable_warnings()

controller='sandboxapic.cisco.com'

def getTicket():
	# put the ip address or dns of your apic-em controller in this url
	url = "https://" + controller + "/api/v1/ticket"

	#the username and password to access the APIC-EM Controller
	payload = {"username":"devnetuser","password":"Cisco123!"}

	#Content type must be included in the header
	header = {"content-type": "application/json"}

	#Performs a POST on the specified url to get the service ticket
	response= requests.post(url,data=json.dumps(payload), headers=header, verify=False)

	print (response)

	#convert response to json format
	r_json=response.json()

	#parse the json to get the service ticket
	ticket = r_json["response"]["serviceTicket"]

	return ticket



def getTopology(ticket):
	# URL for topology REST API call to get list of existing devices on the network, and build topology
	url = "https://" + controller + "/api/v1/topology/physical-topology"

	#Content type as well as the ticket must be included in the header
	header = {"content-type": "application/json", "X-Auth-Token":ticket}

	# this statement performs a GET on the specified network device url
	response = requests.get(url, headers=header, verify=False)

	# json.dumps serializes the json into a string and allows us to
	# print the response in a 'pretty' format with indentation etc.
	print ("Topology = ")
	print (json.dumps(response.json(), indent=4, separators=(',', ': ')))

	#convert data to json format.
	r_json=response.json()

	#Iterate through network device data and list the nodes, their interfaces, status and to what they connect
	for n in r_json["response"]["nodes"]:
		if "platformId" in n:
			print()
			print()
			print('{:30}'.format("Node") + '{:25}'.format("Family") + '{:20}'.format("label")+ "Management IP")
			print('{:30}'.format(n["platformId"]) + '{:25}'.format(n["family"]) + '{:20}'.format(n["label"]) + n["ip"])		
		found=0    #print header flag
		printed=0  #formatting flag
		for i in r_json["response"]["links"]:
			if "startPortName" in i:
				#check that the source device id for the interface matches the node id.  Means interface originated from this device.
				if i["source"] == n["id"]:
					if found==0:
						print('{:>20}'.format("Source Interface") + '{:>15}'.format("Status") + '{:>22}'.format("Target Interface") + '{:>18}'.format("Target"))
						found=1
						printed=1					
					for n1 in r_json["response"]["nodes"]:
						#find name of node to which this one connects
						if i["target"] == n1["id"]:
							print("    " + '{:<25}'.format(i["startPortName"]) + '{:<12}'.format(i["linkStatus"]) + '{:<28}'.format(i["endPortName"]) + '{:<15}'.format(n1["platformId"]))							
							break;
		found=0		
		for i in r_json["response"]["links"]:
			if "startPortName" in i:
				#Find interfaces that link to this one which means this node is the target.
				if i["target"] == n["id"]:
					if found==0:
						if printed==1:
							print()
						print('{:>20}'.format("Source Interface") + '{:>15}'.format("Status") + '{:>22}'.format("Target Interface") + '{:>18}'.format("Source"))
						found=1					
					for n1 in r_json["response"]["nodes"]:
						#find name of node to that connects to this one
						if i["source"] == n1["id"]:
							#print('{:<30}'.format(i["endPortName"]) + '{:>10}'.format(i["linkStatus"]) + '{:>26}'.format(n1["platformId"]))
							print("    " + '{:<25}'.format(i["startPortName"]) + '{:<12}'.format(i["linkStatus"]) + '{:<28}'.format(i["endPortName"]) + '{:<15}'.format(n1["platformId"]))
							break;

theTicket=getTicket()
getTopology(theTicket)
```

Let's look at what the code is doing.  We'll focus on the key code changes.
* *def getTopology(theTicket):*
    * We define the function named getTopology.  This function reads in the topology data.  It parses the nodes which are devices on the network and displays some information about them.  It also parses the link data which are interfaces that connect the nodes and displays information about how they connect the devices and their status. The passed in parameter 'theTicket' is used for authorization purposes.
* *for n in r_json["response"]["nodes"]:*
    * We read the dictionary data for each node into n from which we will parse the data.
* *if "platformId" in n:*
    * Checking that the node in n contains a 'platformId' key.  Some records don't have this key which is the reason for the check.


To run this code sample:
1. Go to directory **coding102-REST-python-ga**.  In the terminal type:
    **cd \DevNetCode\&lt;your-name&gt;\coding-skills-sample-code\coding102-REST-python-ga**
2. Assign the APIC-EM Controller IP address or DNS to the **controller** variable.
    * Open the file **build-topology.py**.  For example, in Windows type: **notepad build-topology.py**
    * *If you are not using your own APIC-EM Controller*, use the [DevNet Sandbox](https://developer.cisco.com/site/devnet/sandbox/) Always-On APIC-EM Lab: [sandboxapic.cisco.com](https://sandboxapic.cisco.com)
        * controller='sandboxapic.cisco.com'
3. Save the file. If encoding type is an option select **UTF-8**.
4. Type the python command and then the filename at the command prompt, and press the return key.
    * *On Windows type*: **py -3 build-topology.py**.  Or type: **python build-topology.py**
    * *On Mac OS or Linux type*: **python3 build-topology.py**
5. The program should execute or display an error message.

    You should see a result like the following.

## Things to Try
* After running the script, review the node data printed. Replace the label attribute that is printed with another attribute such as role or nodeType.
* You may have noticed that no host devices are printed.  Review the data and the source code, and determine why this is so along with how you would print this data. Hint: you can easily identify the host by its attribute nodeType or role.
* Modify the source code so that host devices are printed as well.
* Modify the source code so that interface connections to the hosts are printed as is currently done with the other network devices.
