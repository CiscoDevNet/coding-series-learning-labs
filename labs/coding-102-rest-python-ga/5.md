# Step 5. Manage APIC-EM Users

In this step we're going to continue to use functions to get, create and delete users.


#### manage-users.py
This sample code uses the application REST function call to retrieve a list of the APIC-EM users and their roles. Our goal is to find the users and display information about them.  In addition, we'll create a new user and delete it.


```python
# import requests library
import requests

#import json library
import json


# Disable warnings
requests.packages.urllib3.disable_warnings()


controller='sandboxapic.cisco.com'

#creates and returns a service ticket.
def getTicket():
	print("\nCreating ticket")
	# put the ip address or dns of your apic-em controller in this url
	url = "https://" + controller + "/api/v1/ticket"

	#the username and password to access the APIC-EM Controller
	payload = {"username":"devnetuser","password":"Cisco123!"}

	#Content type must be included in the header
	header = {"content-type": "application/json"}

	#Performs a POST on the specified url to get the service ticket
	response= requests.post(url,data=json.dumps(payload), headers=header, verify=False)

	#convert response to json format
	r_json=response.json()

	#parse the json to get the service ticket
	ticket = r_json["response"]["serviceTicket"]

	return ticket

#Get and display the APIC-EM Users
def getUsers(ticket):
	print("\nGetting list of existing users")
	# URL for user REST API call to get list of APIC-EM users.
	url = "https://" + controller + "/api/v1/user"

	#Content type as well as the ticket must be included in the header
	header = {"content-type": "application/json", "X-Auth-Token":ticket}

	# this statement performs a GET on the specified host url
	response = requests.get(url, headers=header, verify=False)

	# json.dumps serializes the json into a string and allows us to
	# print the response in a 'pretty' format with indentation etc.
	print ("Users = ")
	print (json.dumps(response.json(), indent=4, separators=(',', ': ')))


#Adds a APIC-EM User
def addUser(ticket):
	print("\nAdding new user")
	# URL for user REST API call to get list of existing users in the network.
	url = "https://" + controller + "/api/v1/user"

	#Content type as well as the ticket must be included in the header
	header = {"content-type": "application/json", "X-Auth-Token":ticket}

	username="brett"
	#Data for new user
	payload={"password":"Brett123!","username":username,"authorization":[{"scope":"ALL","role":"ROLE_OBSERVER"}]}

	# this statement performs a Post on the specified user url
	response = requests.post(url, data=json.dumps(payload), headers=header, verify=False)
	print ("Response after post:  " + response.text)

	return (username)


#Delete the user that corresponds to the passed in username parameter
def deleteUser(username, ticket):
	print("\nRemoving user: " + username)
	# URL for a specified user REST API call.
	url = "https://" + controller + "/api/v1/user/" + username

	#Content type as well as the ticket must be included in the header
	header = {"content-type": "application/json", "X-Auth-Token":ticket}

	# this statement performs a Delete on the specified user url
	response = requests.delete(url, headers=header, verify=False)
	print (response.text)


#Show the User that corresponds to the passed in username parameter
def showUser(username, ticket):
	print("\nDisplaying user: " + username)
	# URL for user REST API call to get APIC-EM user with corresponding name.
	url = "https://" + controller + "/api/v1/user/" + username

	#Content type as well as the ticket must be included in the header
	header = {"content-type": "application/json", "X-Auth-Token":ticket}

	# this statement performs a GET on the specified user url
	response = requests.get(url, headers=header, verify=False)
	# json.dumps serializes the json into a string and allows us to
	# print the response in a 'pretty' format with indentation etc.
	print ("User found = ")
	print (json.dumps(response.json(), indent=4, separators=(',', ': ')))


theTicket=getTicket()
getUsers(theTicket)
name=addUser(theTicket)
showUser(name,theTicket)
getUsers(theTicket)
deleteUser(name,theTicket)
getUsers(theTicket)
```

Let's look at what the code is doing.  We'll focus on the key code changes.
* *def addUser(theTicket):*
    * We define the function named addUser.  This function creates a payload with user information and adds it. The passed in parameter 'theTicket' is used for authorization purposes.
* *def deleteUser(username,theTicket):*
    * We define the function named deleteUser which removes a user with the name of the passed in parameter 'username'. The passed in parameter 'theTicket' is used for authorization purposes.

To run this code sample:
1. Go to directory **coding102-REST-python-ga**.  In the terminal type:
    **cd \DevNetCode\&lt;your-name&gt;\coding-skills-sample-code\coding102-REST-python-ga**
2. Assign the APIC-EM Controller IP address or DNS to the **controller** variable.
    * Open the file **manage-users.py**.  For example, in Windows type: **notepad manage-users.py**
    * *If you are not using your own APIC-EM Controller*, use the [DevNet Sandbox](https://developer.cisco.com/site/devnet/sandbox/) Always-On APIC-EM Lab: [sandboxapic.cisco.com](https://sandboxapic.cisco.com)
        * controller='sandboxapic.cisco.com'
3. Save the file. If encoding type is an option select **UTF-8**.
4. Type the python command and then the filename at the command prompt, and press the return key.
    * *On Windows type*: **py -3 manage-users.py**.  Or type: **python manage-users.py**
    * *On Mac OS or Linux type*: **python3 manage-users.py**
5. The program should execute or display an error message.

    You should see a result like the following.

Create service ticket and list users

Add and list user

<br/><br/>
List all users

<br/><br/>
Remove the added user and list remaining users

<br/><br/>


## Things to Try
* Comment out the call to deleteUser(name,theTicket) which would then show as *#deleteUser(name,theTicket)*, and run the program twice.  What error occurs when you try to add an already existing user?   
* Remove the pound sign # from the deleteUser function so reads as *deleteUser(name,theTicket)* then run the program twice.  Is the problem corrected?
* In the showUser(name,theTicket) function call change the name parameter to string 'joe' so the function call reads as *showUser('joe',theTicket)* .  What happens when the user to be shown is not found?
