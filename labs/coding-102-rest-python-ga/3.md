# Step 3. Getting Information About the Network

We are going to build on the previous simple example, and learn how to parse and use the json that is returned in the response.

These files are located on your workstation in the directory: /DevNetCode/&lt;your-name&gt;/coding-skills-sample-code/coding102-REST-python-ga/
* **create-ticket.py** - Example to create a service ticket. Used in Step 2.
* **get-network-hosts.py** – First application to parse the service ticket response and show list of hosts by doing a pretty print of the JSON data
* **get-network-devices.py** – Retrieves network device list and parses JSON to display networkDeviceId values
* **build-topology.py** – Shows how to retrieve devices and interfaces, and to build a spreadsheet-like topology


#### get-network-hosts.py
This sample code uses the host REST function call to retrieve a list of the network hosts.  You may recall from Coding-101 that a host is an end device such as a workstation that is attached to a network device such as a switch via a network cable or wireless device.  Our goal here is to find the hosts and display information about them.


```python
# import requests library
import requests

#import json library
import json

#variable to hold access to the controller
controller='devnetapi.cisco.com/sandbox/apic_em'

# Create the service ticket URL
url = "https://" + controller + "/api/v1/ticket"

#the username and password to access the APIC-EM Controller
payload = {"username":"devnetuser","password":"Cisco123!"}

#Content type must be included in the header
header = {"content-type": "application/json"}

#Performs a POST on the specified url to get the service ticket
response= requests.post(url,data=json.dumps(payload), headers=header, verify=False)

#convert response to json format
r_json=response.json()

#parse the json to get the service ticket
ticket = r_json["response"]["serviceTicket"]

# URL for Host REST API call to get list of exisitng hosts on the network.
url = "https://" + controller + "/api/v1/host"

#Content type must be included in the header as well as the service ticket
header = {"content-type": "application/json", "X-Auth-Token":ticket}

# this statement performs a GET on the specified host url
response = requests.get(url, headers=header, verify=False)

# json.dumps serializes the json into a string and allows us to
# print the response in a 'pretty' format with indentation etc.
print ("Hosts = ")
print (json.dumps(response.json(), indent=4, separators=(',', ': ')))
```

Let's look at what the code is doing.  We'll focus on the key code changes.

* *controller='devnetapi.cisco.com/sandbox/apic_em'*
    * Assign the variable named **controller** the APIC-EM Controller IP or DNS. The DNS assigned here is for the APIC-EM Always-On Sandbox.
* *url = "https://" + controller + "/api/v1/ticket"*
    * Build the url for the service ticket call by concatenating the strings.
* *r_json=response.json()*
    * Convert the returned data to JSON format so can get access to the string.
* *ticket = r_json["response"]["serviceTicket"]*
    * Access the response data to get the service Ticket information.
* *header = {"content-type": "application/json", "X-Auth-Token":ticket}*
    * Pass in service ticket designated as "X-Auth-Token" for API authentication.
* *print (json.dumps(response.json(), indent=4, separators=(',', ': ')))*
    * Pretty print the output so is easy to read.

To run this code sample:
1. Go to directory **coding102-REST-python-ga**.  In the terminal type:
    **cd \DevNetCode\&lt;your-name&gt;\coding-skills-sample-code\coding102-REST-python-ga**
2. Assign the APIC-EM Controller IP address or DNS to the **controller** variable.
    * Open the file **get-network-hosts.py**.  For example, in Windows type: **notepad get-network-hosts.py**
    * *If you are not using your own APIC-EM Controller*, use the [DevNet Sandbox](https://developer.cisco.com/site/devnet/sandbox/) Always-On APIC-EM Lab: [sandboxapic.cisco.com](https://sandboxapic.cisco.com)
        * controller='sandboxapic.cisco.com'
3. Save the file.  If encoding type is an option select **UTF-8**.
4. Type the python command and then the filename at the command prompt, and press the return key.
    * *On Windows type*: **py -3 get-network-hosts.py**.  Or type: **python get-network-hosts.py**
    * *On Mac OS or Linux type*: **python3 get-network-hosts.py**
5. The program should execute or display an error message.

    You should see a result like the following.

## Things to Try
* Do you see the ID for each network host?  
* In file 'get-network-hosts.py' append '?limit=1&offset=1' to the host url so reads as: *url = "https://" + controller + "/api/v1/host?limit=1&offset=1"*, then run the code again.  What change occurred and why?

In the next section, we will learn how to get Network Devices and how to make source code easier to read.
