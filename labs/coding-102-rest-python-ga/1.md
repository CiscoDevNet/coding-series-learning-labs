# Coding 102: Calling REST APIs from Python #

In this Learning Lab you will learn the basics of how to call a REST API in Python.


## Objective ##

Completion Time: 35 minutes

* Understand how to call a REST API from Python
* Explore ways to parse and use the JSON returned from the REST API


## Prerequisites

**Background**
* We recommend that you complete the [Coding 101 Rest Basics Learning Lab](/lab/coding-101-rest-basics-ga/step/1) before you start this lab.

**Access to an APIC-EM Controller**
* To run these code samples, you will need access to an APIC-EM controller.
* **If you are not using your own APIC-EM Controller**, use the [DevNet Sandbox](https://developer.cisco.com/site/devnet/sandbox/) Always-On APIC-EM Lab: ![https://devnetapi.cisco.com/sandbox/apic_em]().

**Python**
* To run the code samples, you need to have Python 3 installed on your machine.
* **If you are working on a DevNet Learning Lab PC at a DevNet event**, Python 3.4.2 is already installed.
* See **How to Set up Your Own Computer** section above for how to install Python on your own machine.

**Python Requests Library**
* These code samples use the Python Requests Library to simplify making REST API calls.
* **If you are working on a DevNet Learning Lab PC at a DevNet event**, the Requests Library is already installed.
* See **How to Set up Your Own Computer** section above for how to install the Requests Library on your own machine.

**Python Flask Library**
* Step 6 uses use the Python Flask Library to interface with NeXt UI.
* **If you are working on a DevNet Learning Lab PC at a DevNet event**, the Flask Library is already installed.
* See **How to Set up Your Own Computer** section above for how to install the Flask Library on your own machine.

**Clone Git Repo**
* **If you are working on a DevNet Learning Lab PC at a DevNet event**,
    * Open the Git Command window by clicking on the *Git CMD* icon on the Task Bar or click on the Start button, then in the Run bar type: **git cmd** and press the **Enter** key.
* **If you are working from your own workstation**, on your desktop open a command terminal.

* Clone the coding skills sample code from GitHub.  Enter the command below.
```
git clone https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/coding-skills-sample-code
```

Inside the directory you created you should now see directory 'coding-skills-sample-code'.<br/><br/>

## Step 1. Find the APIC-EM API Resources

We are going to use the APIC-EM API as an example of a REST API in this lab.  So before we begin, we need to locate the APIC-EM resources on DevNet.

1. In the browser navigate to <a href="https://developer.cisco.com" target="_blank">DevNet</a>
    * Click on the **Login** link located on the top right of the web page.

    * On the Log In web page enter your log in credentials (CCO ID) and click the **Log In** button
    ![](/posts/files/coding-102-rest-python-ga/assets/images/register.png)<br/>
       * If you do not have a Cisco Connection Online ID (CCO ID) click the **Register Now** button and follow the instructions.  When done return to the Log In web page and enter your credentials.
<br/><br/>
2. Use the menu at the top to navigate directly to the APIC-EM developer resources.
   * Click on the **Technologies** link to access the Technology menu.  Inside the menu click on **Networking**  followed by **APIC-EM**<br/>

    <br/><br/>

3. You are now at the APIC-EM web portal.  Open the API reference doc in a separate tab while you are working on this lab.<br/>
