# Coding 102: Calling REST APIs from Python #

In this Learning Lab, you learn the basics of how to call a REST API in Python.


## Objective ##

Completion Time: 35 minutes

* Understand how to call a REST API from Python.
* Explore ways to parse and use the JSON returned from the REST API.


## Prerequisites

**Background**
* Complete the [Coding 101 Rest Basics Learning Lab](/lab/coding-101-rest-basics-ga/step/1) before you start this lab.

**Access to an APIC-EM Controller**
* To run these code samples, you need access to an APIC-EM controller.
* **If you are not using your APIC-EM Controller**, use the [DevNet Sandbox](https://developer.cisco.com/site/devnet/sandbox/) APIC-EM Lab: https://sandboxapicem.cisco.com .

**Python**
* To run the code samples, you need to have Python 3 installed on your computer.
* **If you are working on a DevNet Learning Lab computer at a DevNet event**, Python 3.x is already installed..

For more information, click the "How to Set Up Your Computer" link at the top of this lab.

**Python Requests Library**
* These code samples use the Python Requests Library to simplify making REST API calls.
* **If you are working on a DevNet Learning Lab computer at a DevNet event**, the Requests Library is already installed.

For more information, click the "How to Set Up Your Computer" link at the top of this lab.

**Python Flask Library**
* Step 6 uses use the Python Flask Library to interface with NeXt UI.
* **If you are working on a DevNet Learning Lab computer at a DevNet event**, the Flask Library is already installed.

For more information, click the "How to Set Up Your Computer" link at the top of this lab.

**Clone Git Repo**
* **If you are working on a DevNet Learning Lab computer at a DevNet event**,
    * Open the Git Command window by clicking the *Git CMD* icon on the Task Bar or click the Start button. Then, in the Run bar, enter: `git cmd`.
* **If you are working from your computer**, on your computer open a command terminal.

* Clone the coding skills sample code from GitHub. Enter the following command.
```
git clone https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/coding-skills-sample-code
```

## Step 1. Find the APIC-EM API Resources

You are going to use the APIC-EM API as an example of a REST API in this lab. So before you begin, locate the APIC-EM resources on DevNet.

1. In the browser, navigate to <a href="https://developer.cisco.com" target="_blank">DevNet</a>
    * Click the **Login** link located at the top right of the webpage.

    * On the Log In webpage, enter your log in credentials (CCO ID) and click the **Log In** button
    ![](/posts/files/coding-102-rest-python-ga/assets/images/register.png)<br/>
       * If you do not have a Cisco Connection Online ID (CCO ID), click the **Register Now** button and follow the instructions. When done, return to the Log In webpage and enter your credentials.
<br/><br/>
2. Use the menu at the top to navigate directly to the APIC-EM developer resources.
   * Click the **Technologies** link to access the Technology menu. Inside the menu, click **Networking**  followed by **APIC-EM**<br/>
