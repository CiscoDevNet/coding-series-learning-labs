# Step 4. Get Network Devices

In this step, you create functions to modularize the code and get the network devices. You'll also parse the JSON response data to print out the ID for each network device returned.


#### get-network-devices.py
This sample code uses the network device REST function call to retrieve a list of the network devices. A network device is a component such as a router, switch, or hub that connects computers and other devices to a network. Your goal is to find the network devices and display information about them.


```python
# Import requests library
import requests

# Import json library
import json

controller='devnetapi.cisco.com/sandbox/apic_em'

def getTicket():
	# Put the IP address or DNS of your APIC-EM controller in this URL
	url = "https://" + controller + "/api/v1/ticket"

	# The username and password to access the APIC-EM Controller
	payload = {"username":"devnetuser","password":"Cisco123!"}

	# Content type must be included in the header
	header = {"content-type": "application/json"}

	# Perform a POST on the specified url to get the service ticket
	response= requests.post(url,data=json.dumps(payload), headers=header, verify=False)

	# Convert response to JSON format
	r_json=response.json()

	# Parse the JSON to get the service ticket
	ticket = r_json["response"]["serviceTicket"]

	return ticket


def getNetworkDevices(ticket):
	# URL for network device REST API call to get list of devices on the network.
	url = "https://" + controller + "/api/v1/network-device"

	# Include the content type and ticket in the header
	header = {"content-type": "application/json", "X-Auth-Token":ticket}

	# This statement performs a GET on the specified network device url
	response = requests.get(url, headers=header, verify=False)

	# json.dumps serializes the JSON into a string and enables you to
	# Print the response in a 'pretty' format with indentation etc.
	print ("Network Devices = ")
	print (json.dumps(response.json(), indent=4, separators=(',', ': ')))

  # Convert data to JSON format.
	r_json=response.json()

  # Iterate through network device data and print the id and series name of each device
	for i in r_json["response"]:
		print(i["id"] + "   " + i["series"])

# Call the functions
theTicket=getTicket()
getNetworkDevices(theTicket)
```

Now, look at what the code is doing. Focus on the key code changes.

* `def getTicket():`
    * Define this function, which creates and returns the service ticket. For more information on Python Functions see this [DevNet Learning Lab](https://learninglabs.cisco.com/tracks/devnet-beginner/fundamentals/00-prep-04-python-primer2/step/4)
* `def getNetworkDevices(ticket):`
    * Define this function, which uses the parameter ticket. The ticket parameter should contain the service ticket data. This function returns the network devices.
* `url = "https://" + controller + "/api/v1/network-device"`
    * Creates the URL to get the network devices by concatenating the strings.
* `header = {"content-type": "application/json", "X-Auth-Token":ticket}`
    * HTTP header with the ticket data designated as "X-Auth-Token" for API authentication.
* `for i in r_json["response"]: print(i["id"] + "   " + i["series"])`
    * Parse the network data JSON data and print out the device ID and the device series name.
* `theTicket=getTicket()`
    * Call this function and assign the service ticket data to the variable named `theTicket`.
* `getNetworkDevices(theTicket)`
    * Call this function and pass in the service ticket data in the `theTicket` variable.

To run this code sample:
1. In a terminal, enter:
    `cd \DevNetCode\~your-name~\coding-skills-sample-code\coding102-REST-python-ga`
2. Assign the APIC-EM Controller IP address or DNS to the **controller** variable.
    * Open the file `get-network-devices.py`. For example, in Windows, enter: `notepad get-network-hosts.py`
    * *If you are not using your APIC-EM Controller*, use the [DevNet Sandbox](https://developer.cisco.com/site/devnet/sandbox/) APIC-EM Lab: [sandboxapic.cisco.com](https://sandboxapic.cisco.com)
        * controller='sandboxapic.cisco.com'
3. Save the file. If encoding type is an option, select **UTF-8**.
4. At the command prompt, enter the `python` command followed by the filename.
    * On Windows, enter: `py -3 get-network-devices.py` or `python get-network-devices.py`
    * On Mac OS or Linux, enter: `python3 get-network-devices.py`
5. The program should run or display an error message.

    You should see a result like the following one. For brevity, warnings and some records have been removed.

## Things to Try
* Edit the `getNetworkDevices` function to display the management IP address and location of each network device.
* Write a new function called `getHosts(theTicket)` that gets and displays the network hosts. See step 3 for the URL that retrieves host data.

Next, you learn how to build a network topology.
