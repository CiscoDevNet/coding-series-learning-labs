# Step 2. Make your first REST call from Python

The following code makes a simple POST request using the [Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/install/# install) library.

```python
# Import requests library
import requests

# Import json library
import json

# Put the IP address or DNS of your APIC-EM controller in this URL
url = 'https://{APIC-EM-Controller}/api/v1/ticket'

# The username and password to access the APIC-EM Controller
payload = {"username":"devnetuser","password":"Cisco123!"}

# Content type must be included in the header
header = {"content-type": "application/json"}

# Perform a POST on the specified url.
response= requests.post(url,data=json.dumps(payload), headers=header, verify=False)

# Print the JSON that is returned
print(response.text)
```

Now, look at what the code is doing.

* First, it imports the requests library.
    * The requests library [Requests Library Installation](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/install/# install) should already be completed as prescribed in step one.
    * The [Requests Library Functions](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/) simplify making HTTP calls, and provides REST call support for methods such as post, get, and delete.
* Next, it imports the JSON library.
    * This library is used in this code snippet to format data into JSON format.
    * The library exists within Python, but must be imported in order to access its functions.
* The next line creates a variable called **url** that contains the URL you are going to use in the request.
    * This example uses a REST call that returns the service ticket. This ticket is used for authentication when making all other REST function calls in the APIC-EM API.
    * See the [Coding 101: Rest Basics Learning Lab](/lab/coding-101-rest-basics-ga/step/1) for information about how REST calls work.
* `payload = {"username":"devnetuser","password":"Cisco123!"}`
    * To create a service ticket the program must log into the APIC-EM Controller, so the username and password are needed. The username/password provided are for the Sandbox Database for APIC-EM which is https://sandboxapic.cisco.com
* `header = {"content-type": "application/json"}`
    * The content-type header tells the APIC-EM Controller what type of formatted data it is receiving.
* `response= requests.post(url,data=json.dumps(payload), headers=header, verify=False)`
    * Makes a request to the specified url using the POST method.
    * The payload data is converted to JSON format and passed in.
    * The header is passed in.
    * The response from the function call is returned to the variable named `response`.
* `print (response.text)` prints the JSON that was returned in the response to the screen.


#### A Note about SSL Certificates and use of verify=False

You will notice that the examples in this learning lab use the **verify=False** parameter.

```python
# This statement performs a POST on the specified url
response= requests.post(url,data=json.dumps(payload), headers=header, verify=False)
```
Setting **verify=False** tells the requests library to ignore verifying the SSL certificate.

This setting is convenient for lab testing environments that often have self-signed certificates.

**DO NOT** use this setting in a production environment.

## Give it a try!

To run this code sample:
1. Open a terminal and go to the directory created back in Step 1 named: ** DevNetCode\~your-name~**
    * In the **Prerequisites section** of Step 1 you had cloned the source code files from the git repository into this directory. Inside the directory you created you should see subdirectory `coding-skills-sample-code`. If that subdirectory does not exist, go back to the Step 1 prerequisites section and follow the steps to create the directory and clone the git repository.
2. In the terminal, enter:
`cd \DevNetCode\~your-name~\coding-skills-sample-code\coding102-REST-python-ga`
3. Open the file `create-ticket.py`  For example, in Windows, enter: `notepad create-ticket.py`
4. Change the {APIC-EM-Server} IP address in the URL to be the IP address of the controller you are using .
    * *If you are not using your APIC-EM Controller*, use the [DevNet Sandbox](https://sandboxapicem.cisco.com/) APIC-EM Lab by entering: [sandboxapic.cisco.com](https://sandboxapic.cisco.com)
5. Save the file. If encoding type is an option, select **UTF-8**.
6. At the command prompt, enter the `python` command followed by the filename.
    * On Windows, enter: `py -3 create-ticket.py` or `python create-ticket.py`
    * On Mac OS or Linux, enter: `python3 create-ticket.py`
7. The program should run or display an error message.

You should see a result like the following one.

![](/posts/files/coding-102-rest-python-ga/assets/images/create-ticket.png)

This program displays the raw JSON from the service ticket data.

## Things to Observe
* Do you see the security warning?
* Do you see the service ticket value?

In the next few sections, you look at how to use the service ticket when making other REST API calls and how to parse the JSON that is returned in the response.
