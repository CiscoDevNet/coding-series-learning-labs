## Step 5. Save data from JSON to a file
Often, when you are working with REST APIs (see [Coding 101: Rest Basics Learning Lab](/lab/coding-101-rest-basics-ga/step/1) ), it is handy to be able to save some data to a file.

You can combine the techniques for writing to a file with the techniques for calling REST APIs that you learned in [Coding 102 Calling REST APIs from Python](/lab/coding-102-rest-python-ga/step/1)

Now, look at an example that retrieves some JSON from the [DNA Center APIs](https://developer.cisco.com/site/dna-center-rest-api/).

```python
# Import the requests library so you can use it to make REST calls (https://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/index.html)
import requests

# Import the JSON library. This library provides many handy features for formatting, displaying
# and manipulating json.
import json

# All of your REST calls will use the URL for the APIC EM Controller as the base URL
# Define a variable for the controller IP or DNS so you don't have to keep entering it
controller_url = "https://devnetapi.cisco.com/sandbox/apic_em"

# The username and password to access the DNA Center
payload = {"username":"devnetuser","password":"Cisco123!"}

ticket_url = controller_url + "/api/v1/ticket"

# Content type must be included in the header
header = {"content-type": "application/json"}

# Perform a POST on the specified url to get the token
response= requests.post(ticket_url,data=json.dumps(payload), headers=header, verify=False)

# Convert response to JSON format
r_json=response.json()

# Parse the JSON to get the token
ticket = r_json["response"]["serviceTicket"]

# Get Devices
# This function enables you to view a list of 3 of the devices in the network(routers and switches).
get_devices_url = controller_url + '/api/v1/network-device/1/3'

# Include the content type and ticket in the header
header = {"content-type": "application/json", "X-Auth-Token":ticket}

# Perform GET on get_devices_url
get_devices_response = requests.get(get_devices_url, headers=header, verify=False)

# The JSON method of the response object returned by requests.get returns the request body in JSON format
get_devices_json = get_devices_response.json()

# Now, read and display some specific information from the JSON

# Set your parent as the top level response object
parent =  get_devices_json["response"]

print ("Devices = ")
# You can open the file using 'with'.
# 'with' provides better exception handling and closes the file
with open("list-of-devices.txt", "w") as file:
    # For each device returned, write the networkDeviceId and type value to the file
    for item in parent:
        device="id = " + item["id"] + " type = " + item["type"]
        file.write (device + "\n")
        print(device)

```
Now, look at what is going on in the code.

* First, you use the Request library to create a token using the DNA Center API.
* You then call the DNA Center API and pass in the ticket to retrieve the list of network devices.
* This statement, `get_devices_response = requests.get(get_devices_url, headers=header, verify=False)`, is the line that calls the API.
* Then, you create a JSON object, `get_devices_json`, containing the JSON that is returned.
* Next, you open a file and loop through the JSON object and print the ID and type for each device that was returned to the file and the screen.

### Give it a try!
To run this code sample:
1. In a terminal, enter:
    `cd \DevNetCode\~your-name~\coding-skills-sample-code\coding-205-writing-file-ga`
2. Assign the DNA Center IP address or DNS to the `controller_url` variable.
    * Open the file `write-json-to-file.py`. For example, in Windows, enter: `notepad write-json-to-file.py`
    * *If you are not using your DNA Center*, use the [DevNet Sandbox](https://developer.cisco.com/site/devnet/sandbox/) DNA Center Lab: [devnetapi.cisco.com/sandbox/apic_em](https://devnetapi.cisco.com/sandbox/apic_em)
        * controller_url='https://devnetapi.cisco.com/sandbox/apic_em'
3. Save the file. If encoding type is an option, select **UTF-8**.
4. At the command prompt, enter the `python` command followed by the filename.
    * On Windows, enter: `py -3 write-json-to-file.py` or `python write-json-to-file.py`
    * On Mac OS or Linux, enter: `python3 write-json-to-file.py`
5. The program should run or display an error message.


Your text file should contain the following when you open it after running your program.
