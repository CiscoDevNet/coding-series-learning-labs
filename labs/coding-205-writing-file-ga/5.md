## Step 5. Save data from JSON to a file
Often, when you are working with REST APIs (see [Coding 101: Rest Basics Learning Lab](/#/labs/coding-101-rest-basics-ga/step/1) ), it is handy to be able to save some data to a file.

We can combine the techniques for writing to a file that we just learned with the techniques for calling REST APIs that we learned in [Coding 101 Calling REST APIs from Python](/#/labs/coding-101-rest-python/step/1)

Let's take a look at an example that retrieves some JSON from the [APIC-EM APIs](https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/apiplatform/cisco-dev/#/portals/organizations/de91ddd1-9fb8-4731-8bce-03f47c3ba41a/apis/56056/versions/58124/pages/75870).

```python
# import the requests library so we can use it to make REST calls (http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/index.html)
import requests

# import the json library.  This library gives us many handy features for formatting, displaying
# and manipulating json.
import json

# All of our REST calls will use the url for the APIC EM Controller as the base URL
# So lets define a variable for the controller IP or DNS so we don't have to keep typing it
controller_url = "https://sandboxapic.cisco.com:9443"

#the username and password to access the APIC-EM Controller
payload = {"username":"admin","password":"C!sc0123"}

ticket_url = controller_url + "/api/v1/ticket"

#Content type must be included in the header
header = {"content-type": "application/json"}

#Performs a POST on the specified url to get the service ticket
response= requests.post(ticket_url,data=json.dumps(payload), headers=header, verify=False)

#convert response to json format
r_json=response.json()

#parse the json to get the service ticket
ticket = r_json["response"]["serviceTicket"]

# Get Devices
# This function allows you to view a list of 3 of the devices in the network(routers and switches).
get_devices_url = controller_url + '/api/v1/network-device/1/3'

#Content type as well as the ticket must be included in the header
header = {"content-type": "application/json", "X-Auth-Token":ticket}

#Perform GET on get_devices_url
get_devices_response = requests.get(get_devices_url, headers=header, verify=False)

# The json method of the response object returned by requests.get returns the request body in json format
get_devices_json = get_devices_response.json()

#Now let's read and display some specific information from the json

# set our parent as the top level response object
parent =  get_devices_json["response"]

print ("Devices = ")
# you can open the file using 'with'.
# 'with' gives you better exception handling and when you use 'with' the file automatically be closed
with open("list-of-devices.txt", "w") as file:
    # for each device returned, write the networkDeviceId and type value to the file
    for item in parent:
        device="id = " + item["id"] + " type = " + item["type"]
        file.write (device + "\n")
        print(device)

```
Let's look at what is going on in the code.

* First we use the Request library to create a service ticket using the APIC-EM API.
* We then call the APIC-EM API and pass in the ticket to retrieve the list of network devices.
* This statement, **get_devices_response = requests.get(get_devices_url, headers=header, verify=False)**, is the line that calls the API.
* Then, we create a json object, **get_devices_json**, containing the json that is returned
* Next, we open a file and loop through the json object and print the ID and type for each device that was returned to the file and the screen.

### Give it a try!
To run this code sample:
1. Go to directory **coding-205-writing-file-ga**.  In the terminal type:
    **cd \DevNetCode\&lt;your-name&gt;\coding-skills-sample-code\coding-205-writing-file-ga**
2. Assign the APIC-EM Controller IP address or DNS to the **controller_url** variable.
    * Open the file **write-json-to-file.py**.  For example, in Windows type: **notepad write-json-to-file.py**
    * *If you are not using your own APIC-EM Controller*, use the [DevNet Sandbox](https://developer.cisco.com/site/devnet/sandbox/) Always-On APIC-EM Lab: [sandboxapic.cisco.com:9443](https://sandboxapic.cisco.com:9443)
        * controller_url='https://sandboxapic.cisco.com:9443'
3. Save the file. If encoding type is an option select **UTF-8**.
4. Type the python command and then the filename at the command prompt, and press the return key.
    * *On Windows type*: **py -3 write-json-to-file.py**.  Or type: **python write-json-to-file.py**
    * *On Mac OS or Linux type*: **python3 create-device-list.py**
5. The program should execute or display an error message.


Your text file should contain the following when you open it after running your program.
