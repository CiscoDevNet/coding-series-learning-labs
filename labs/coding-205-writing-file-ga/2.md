## Step 2. Write to a file
Here is some example code that writes a sentence to a file.

```python
# Use the open method to open a file
# Pass in the name of the file to open and mode. 'r' for read only 'w' if you want to write to the file
# To write to this file you use "w"
# If the file does not exist, it will be created.
my_file_object = open("my-new-file.txt", "w")

my_file_object.write("The grey penguin flies at noon.")

my_file_object.close()

```
Now, look at what is going on in the code.

* The `my_file_object = open("my-new-file.txt", "w")` statement opens a file in 'write' mode.
  * The "w" opens the file in write mode.
  * When using "w" write mode, the contents of the file will be OVERWRITTEN.
  * If the file does not already exist, it will be created.
* The `my_file_object.write()` statement writes the specified statement to the file.
* The `my_file_object.close()` statement closes the file. (Don't forget to close your files!)

### Give it a try!

To run this code sample:
1. Open a text editor.
    * For example, *on a DevNet Learning Lab computer*, open Notepad++. (e.g., **Start > Notepad++**)
3. Create a folder for this lab.
    * For example, *on a DevNet Learning Lab computer*, create a folder in "C:\Coding-205\yourname". Enter command: `mkdir Coding-205\{yourname}`
      * where {yourname} is replaced by your first name.
6. Copy/paste the code shown into your new file.
7. Save the file with the extension `.py` in your new directory. For example, `write-file.py`.
8. Open a command prompt.
    * For example, *on a DevNet Learning Lab computer*, click **Start > Command Prompt**.
9. At the command line, go to the directory where you saved the `write-file.py` file.
    * For example, *on a DevNet Learning Lab computer*, enter: `cd Coding-205\{yourname}`
10. At the command prompt, enter the `python` command followed by the filename.
    * On Windows, enter: `py -3 write-file.py` or enter: `python write-file.py`
    * On Mac OS or Linux, enter: `python3 write-file.py`
11. The program should run or display an error message.

Your text file should contain the following when you open it after running your program.

### Things to Try
* Try writing multiple lines of text to the file.
