## Step 2. Write to a file
Here is some example code that writes a sentence to a file.

```python
# Use the open method to open a file
# Pass in the name of the file to open and mode. 'r' for read only 'w' if you want to write to the file
# To write to this file we will use "w"
# If the file does not exist, it will be created.
my_file_object = open("my-new-file.txt", "w")

my_file_object.write("The grey penguin flies at noon.")

my_file_object.close()

```
Let's look at what is going on in the code.

* The **my_file_object = open("my-new-file.txt", "w")** statement opens a file in 'write' mode.
    * The "w" indicates that we want to open the file in write mode.
    * When using "w" write mode, the contents of the file will be OVERWRITTEN.
    * If the file does not already exist, it will be created.
* The **my_file_object.write()** statement writes the specified statement to the file.
* The **my_file_object.close()** statement closes the file. (Don't forget to close your files!)

### Give it a try!

To run this code sample:
1. Open a text editor.
    * *On a DevNet Learning Lab PC*, open Notepad++ (Start Menu -> Notepad++)
3. Create a folder for this lab.
    * *On a DevNet Learning Lab PC*, create a folder in "C:\Coding-205\yourname".  Enter command: `mkdir Coding-205\{yourname}`
      * where {yourname} is replaced by your first name.
6. Copy/paste the code above into your new file.
7. Save the file with the extension **.py** in your new directory.  For example, **write-file.py**.
8. Open a command prompt.
    * *On a DevNet Learning Lab PC*, (Start --> Command Prompt)
9. At the command line, go to the directory where you saved the **write-file.py** file.
    * *On a DevNet Learning Lab PC*, `cd Coding-205\{yourname}`
10. Type the python command and then the filename at the command prompt, and hit return.
    * *On Windows*, **py -3 write-file.py** or type: **python write-file.py**
    * *On Mac OS or Linux*, **python3 write-file.py**
11. The program should execute or display an error message.

Your text file should contain the following when you open it after running your program.

### Things to Try
* Try writing multiple lines of text to the file.
