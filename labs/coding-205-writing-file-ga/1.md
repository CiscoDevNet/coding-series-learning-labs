# Coding 205: Writing data to a file using Python

In this Learning Lab, you will learn how to write data to a file.


## Objective ##

Completion Time: 15 minutes

* Understand how to write data to a file
* Understand how to append data to a file


## Prerequisites

**Python**
* To run the code samples, you need to have Python 3 installed on your machine.
* **If you are working on a DevNet Learning Lab PC at a DevNet event**, Python 3.4.2 is already installed.
* See **How to Set up Your Own Computer** section above for how to install Python on your own machine.

**Python Requests Library**
* The code sample in Step 5 uses the Python Requests Library to simplify making REST API calls.
* **If you are working on a DevNet Learning Lab PC at a DevNet event**, the Requests Library is already installed.
* See **How to Set up Your Own Computer** section above for how to install the Requests Library on your own machine.

**Clone Git Repo**
* **If you are working on a DevNet Learning Lab PC at a DevNet event**
    * Open the Git Command window by clicking on the *Git CMD* icon on the Task Bar or click on the Start button, then in the Run bar type: **git cmd** and press the **Enter** key.
* **If you are working from your own workstation**, on your desktop open a command terminal.
* Go to the root directory by typing: `cd \`
* Create a directory called 'C:\DevNetCode\yourname' by typing: `mkdir DevNetCode\<your-name>`
    * For example: `mkdir DevNetCode\brTiller`
* Go to the new directory by typing: `cd \DevNetCode\<your-name>`
    * For example: `cd \DevNetCode\brTiller`
* Clone the coding skills sample code from GitHub.  Enter the command below.

```
git clone https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/coding-skills-sample-code
```

Inside the directory you created you should now see directory 'coding-skills-sample-code'.<br/><br/>

## Step 1. Introduction

When writing applications, you often need to save some information to a text file.

Python makes this operation really easy.

Here's a simple example that creates a file named **my-new-file.txt** and writes the line "The grey penguin flies at noon." to the file.

```python
# Use the open method to open a file
# Pass in the name of the file to open and mode. 'r' for read only 'w' if you want to write to the file
# To write to this file we will use "w"
# If the file does not exist, it will be created.
my_file_object = open("my-new-file.txt", "w")

my_file_object.write("The grey penguin flies at noon.")

my_file_object.close()

```
Fairly simple, right?  Let's try it!
