# Coding 205: Writing data to a file using Python

In this Learning Lab, you learn how to write data to a file.


## Objective ##

Completion Time: 15 minutes

* Understand how to write data to a file.
* Understand how to append data to a file.


## Prerequisites

**Python**
* To run the code samples, you need to have Python 3 installed on your computer.
* **If you are working on a DevNet Learning Lab computer at a DevNet event**, Python 3.x is already installed..

For more information, click the "How to Set Up Your Computer" link at the top of this lab.

**Python Requests Library**
* The code sample in Step 5 uses the Python Requests Library to simplify making REST API calls.
* **If you are working on a DevNet Learning Lab computer at a DevNet event**, the Requests Library is already installed.

For more information, click the "How to Set Up Your Computer" link at the top of this lab.

**Clone Git Repo**
* **If you are working on a DevNet Learning Lab computer at a DevNet event**
    * Open the Git Command window by clicking the *Git CMD* icon on the Task Bar or click the Start button. Then, in the Run bar, enter: `git cmd`.
* **If you are working from your computer**, on your computer open a command terminal.
* Go to the root directory by entering: `cd \`
* Create a directory called 'C:\DevNetCode\yourname' by entering: `mkdir DevNetCode\<your-name>`
    * For example: `mkdir DevNetCode\brTiller`
* Go to the new directory by entering: `cd \DevNetCode\<your-name>`
    * For example: `cd \DevNetCode\brTiller`
* Clone the coding skills sample code from GitHub. Enter the following command.

```
git clone https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/coding-skills-sample-code
```

Inside the directory you created , you should see a new directory, 'coding-skills-sample-code'.<br/><br/>

## Step 1. Introduction

When writing applications, you often need to save some information to a text file.

Python makes this operation easy.

Here is a simple example that creates a file named **my-new-file.txt** and writes the line "The grey penguin flies at noon." to the file.

```python
# Use the open method to open a file
# Pass in the name of the file to open and mode. 'r' for read only 'w' if you want to write to the file
# To write to this file you use "w"
# If the file does not exist, it will be created.
my_file_object = open("my-new-file.txt", "w")

my_file_object.write("The grey penguin flies at noon.")

my_file_object.close()

```
Fairly simple, right?  Now, try it!
