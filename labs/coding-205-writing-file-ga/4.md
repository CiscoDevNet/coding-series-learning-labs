## Step 4. Append to a file
Take a look at the following code.

What do you think the result will be?

```python
print ("Writing to file..")

# you can open the file using 'with'.
# 'with' gives you better exception handling and when you use 'with' the file automatically be closed
with open("my-new-file2.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Cisco Developers are 1337!\n")
    file.write("DevNet Developers rock!")

print ("Do some stuff outside of the with block")

# open the file again and append some additional text
with open("my-new-file2.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Level up!\n")
    file.write("Go to developer.cisco.com and do more learning labs!")

```
Copy this code into your **write-file.py** file and run it.

What happened?

* The first two lines that we wrote **OVERWRITTEN** by the second two lines. Oops!
    * When we open a file using the 'w' Write mode, the file is written over if it exists.
* But, what if we want to add to an existing file?
    * To append to a file, use 'a' when opening the file.

Here is an example:

```python
print ("Writing to file..")

# you can open the file using 'with'.
# 'with' gives you better exception handling and when you use 'with' the file automatically be closed
with open("my-new-file2.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Cisco Developers are 1337!\n")
    file.write("DevNet Developers rock!")

print ("Do some stuff outside of the with block")

# open the file again and append some additional text
with open("my-new-file2.txt", "a") as file:
    file.write("Level up!\n")
    file.write("Go to developer.cisco.com and do more learning labs!")
```

### Give it a try!

To run this code sample:
1. Open a text editor.
    * *On a DevNet Learning Lab PC*, open Notepad++ (Start Menu -> Notepad++)
3. Open your **write-file.py** file you created in the previous step.
6. Copy/paste the code above into your new file.
7. Save the file with the extension **.py** in your new directory.  For example, **write-file.py**.
8. Open a command prompt.
    * *On a DevNet Learning Lab PC*, (Start --> Command Prompt)
9. At the command line, go to the directory where you saved the **write-file.py** file.
    * *On a DevNet Learning Lab PC*, **cd C:\Coding-205\yourname**
10. Type the python command and then the filename at the command prompt, and hit return.
    * *On Windows*, **py -3 write-file.py** or type: **python write-file.py**
    * *On Mac OS or Linux*, **python3 write-file.py**
11. The program should execute or display an error message.

Your text file should contain the following when you open it after running your program.
