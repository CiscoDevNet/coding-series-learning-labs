## Step 3. Write to a file using 'with'
The best way to open and write to a file in Python is to use the [with](https://docs.python.org/3.4/reference/compound_stmts.html#with) statement.

The **with** statement is used to wrap the execution of a block with methods defined by a context manager.

When you are opening files, this means that **with** gives you better exception handling and (bonus!) **with** will automatically close the file for you.

Using **with** is definitely the best practice when working with files.

```python
print ("Writing to file..")

# you can open the file using 'with'.
# 'with' gives you better exception handling and when you use 'with' the file automatically be closed
with open("my-new-file2.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Cisco Developers are 1337!\n")
    file.write("DevNet Developers rock!")

```
Let's look at what is going on in the code.

* Open the file using with **with open("my-new-file2.txt", "w") as file:**
    * We specify that we want to open the file in **Write** mode by passing in 'w'.
    * The file object will be returned into the variable **file**
* Then, we write two lines to the file.
* The '\n' character is like pressing the return key.
* We don't need a **.close()** statement because **with** closes the file for us.

### Give it a try!

To run this code sample:
1. Open a text editor.
    * *On a DevNet Learning Lab PC*, open Notepad++ (Start Menu -> Notepad++)
3. Open your **write-file.py** file you created in the previous step.
6. Copy/paste the code above into your new file.
7. Save the file with the extension **.py** in your new directory.  For example, **write-file.py**.
8. Open a command prompt.
    * *On a DevNet Learning Lab PC*, (Start --> Command Prompt)
9. At the command line, go to the directory where you saved the **write-file.py** file.
    * *On a DevNet Learning Lab PC*, **cd C:\Coding-205\yourname**
10. Type the python command and then the filename at the command prompt, and hit return.
    * *On Windows*, **py -3 write-file.py** or type: **python write-file.py**
    * *On Mac OS or Linux*, **python3 write-file.py**
11. The program should execute or display an error message.

Your text file should contain the following when you open it after running your program.
