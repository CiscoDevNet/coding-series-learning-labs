## Step 3. Write to a file using 'with'
The best way to open and write to a file in Python is to use the [with](https://docs.python.org/3.4/reference/compound_stmts.html# with) statement.

The `with` statement wraps a block with methods defined by a context manager.

When you are opening files, `with` provides better exception handling and automatically closes the file.

Using `with` is definitely the best practice when working with files.

```python
print ("Writing to file..")

# You can open the file using 'with'.
# 'with' provides better exception handling and closes the file
with open("my-new-file2.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Cisco Developers are 1337!\n")
    file.write("DevNet Developers rock!")
```

Now, look at what is going on in the code.

* Open the file using `with open("my-new-file2.txt", "w") as file:`
    * Open the file in **Write** mode by passing in `w`.
    * The file object will be returned to the variable named `file`
* Then, write two lines to the file.
* The '\n' character is like pressing the return key.
* The code doesn't need a `.close()` statement because `with` closes the file.

### Give it a try!

To run this code sample:
1. Open a text editor.
    * For example, *on a DevNet Learning Lab computer*, open Notepad++. (e.g., **Start > Notepad++**)
3. Open your `write-file.py` file you created in the previous step.
6. Copy/paste the code shown into your new file.
7. Save the file with the extension `.py` in your new directory. For example, `write-file.py`.
8. Open a command prompt.
    * For example, *on a DevNet Learning Lab computer*, click **Start > Command Prompt**.
9. At the command line, go to the directory where you saved the `write-file.py` file.
    * For example, *on a DevNet Learning Lab computer*, enter: `cd C:\Coding-205\yourname`
10. At the command prompt, enter the `python` command followed by the filename.
    * On Windows, enter: `py -3 write-file.py` or enter: `python write-file.py`
    * On Mac OS or Linux, enter: `python3 write-file.py`
11. The program should run or display an error message.

Your text file should contain the following when you open it after running your program.
