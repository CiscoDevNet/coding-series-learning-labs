# Step 3. Python Data Types

In this step we'll explore Python data types.  There are many data types listed in the figure below.  There are simple numeric ones like **integers** and **floats**.  For our purposes the differences between a **float** and an **integer** is that a **float** has a decimal in it.  For example 52.856 is a **float** while 52 is an **integer**.  **Boolean** data types can only be either True or False.  **Text** is a data type with a non-numeric value. **Text** is more commonly called **string**. For example: "brett" is a **string**, so is 'brett123', but 123 is an **integer**.

There are also more complex data types such as list, tuples and dictionaries.  Let's delve into these types.

A [**list**](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_lists.htm) contains any number of sequential elements and is defined by square brackets [].  Here's a list *['Martha','Betty',5]* .  Assigning a list to a variable is as simple as *var=['Martha','Betty',5]*. Lists are mutable which means that they can be changed.  You can add data to a list, modify and delete it or even sort it.  Notice that lists can have different data types inside them.

A [**tuple**](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_tuples.htm) contains any number of sequential elements and is defined by parenthesis ().  Here's a tuple *('Brett',9,'Cisco')*.  Assigning a tuple to a variable is simple: *var1=('Brett',9,'Cisco')*. Tuples are similar to lists, but they are immutable which means they cannot be changed.  You might use a tuple to group similar data.  For example, referring to the tuple defined above the similarity is that my name is Brett and I've worked at Cisco for 9 years.  Because tuples are immutable they are more efficient meaning that their data can be accessed more quickly than lists.

While lists and tuples are defined a little differently, they both have their data accessed the same manner which is by square brackets [].  The first data element always starts at position zero.  In the example in the list that was defined earlier if I entered the python statement **print(var[0])**, it would display *Martha*.  If I entered the python statement **print(var[1])**, it would display *Betty* and so on.  The same syntax applies to tuples.  For the tuple defined above if I entered the python statement **print(var1[0])**, it would display *Brett*.  If I entered the python statement **print(var1[1])**, it would display *9* and so on

A [**dictionary**](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_dictionary.htm) is a different than lists and tuples. Each element in a dictionary must contain a key followed by a value.  This key value association is typically referred to as *name value pairs*.  Dictionaries are defined by curly braces {}. Here's a dictionary *{"car":"corvette","age":7, "food":"pizza"}* .  Assigning a dictionary to a variable is simple: *myvar={"car":"corvette","age":7, "food":"pizza"}* .  The value in a dictionary is accessed by its key.  For example if I entered the python statement **print(myvar["car"])**, it would display *corvette*.  If I entered the python statement **print(myvar["food"])**, it would display *pizza* and so on.  Dictionaries are sometimes also called *maps* or *associative arrays* .


Examples of how to define each Python data type is shown in the table below.

## Give it a try!
1. In Step 2 you created and ran python script myworld.py .  Now let's add to this script.<br/>
   a. Add a list with two elements and assign it to a variable.<br/>
   b. Add a tuple with three elements and assign it to a variable..<br/>
   c. Add a dictionary with two name value pairs and assign it to a variable..<br/>
   d. Print one value from each data type you created.<br/>

2. Now open file data-types-values.py .  Which values should be displayed for each data type?  Run the script to check your answers.

3. Modify the file data-type-values.py to create errors. For example, change the line *print(my_dict["green"])* to *print(my_dict["mean"])* .  What error is displayed?
