# Step 5. Loops

In this step we're going to learn about writing loops and functions in Python. We'll use this new skill to more easily parse JSON data that contains arrays.

There are many reasons to write loops in Python or any coding language for that matter.  The most common reason is that you have a list of data that you want to process. You might have noticed in the previous steps that when you wanted to access an object inside a JSON array that you had to specify the element number.  Imagine how difficult that would be if you had to do the same thing for a hundred or a thousand objects!  Loops make processing lists much easier because the loop will iterate through each object which you can then process via the source code you write.

Let's start by looking at different types of loops in python

The first type of loop uses the range function to specify a fixed amount of iterations that will occur in a loop.  The first example specifies there should be 5 iterations.  By default Python will start counting from 0 so going from 0 to 4 is 5 iterations.  In the next example we provide a starting and ending point.  Here there will be three iterations since python excludes the last number, so the iterations will be 2,3,4.  The **in** keyword is important because this keyword causes the value iterated over in the range to be assigned to the variable count.  In this case that means that the variable name **count** in incremented with each iteration.  Similarly in the example **for fruit in basket**, **basket** is an array that we iterate over and with each iteration the value found is assigned to the variable named **fruit** which we can then parse.  In the final two examples, **while loops** don't assign a value to a variable and are typically used for processing inputs or data that is not in a list.  For example, the **while True** infinite loop might be used when waiting for user input.

Using this new information about loops let's see how we can now process more JSON data much more quickly.  In step 4 you parsed the JSON data about donuts to get the *chocolate* flavor.  However, it would be much more time consuming and difficult if you wanted to get each donut flavor and it's corresponding id without using a loop.  See the example below.

``` python
donut={"type":"donut","flavors":{"flavor":[{"type":"chocolate","id":"1001"}, {"type":"glazed","id":"1002"},{"type":"sprinkled","id":"1003"}]}}

#Parse JSON without loops
print(donut["flavors"]["flavor"][0]["id"] + "  " + donut["flavors"]["flavor"][0]["type"])
print(donut["flavors"]["flavor"][1]["id"] + "  " + donut["flavors"]["flavor"][1]["type"])
print(donut["flavors"]["flavor"][2]["id"] + "  " + donut["flavors"]["flavor"][2]["type"])
print()

#Parse JSON with loops
for hungry in donut["flavors"]["flavor"]:
	print(hungry["id"] + "  " + hungry["type"])

```

You can also parse data using loops that are not included in arrays. For example in step 4 you parsed JSON data about cars. However, what if you wanted to print out each car make along with its corresponding model? You could use a loop to print out each without a problem.  Let's see how it's done below with the old way versus the better way.

``` python
cars={"sports":{"porsche":"Volkswagon","Viper":"Dodge","Corvette":"Chevy"}}

#Parse JSON without loops
print("porsche  " + cars["sports"]["porsche"])
print("Viper  " + cars["sports"]["Viper"])
print("Corvette  " + cars["sports"]["Corvette"])
print()

#Parse JSON with loops
for auto in cars["sports"]:
	print(auto + "  " + cars["sports"][auto])
```

Here's the output from running our script parsing each JSON data with the old and new way.

Let's review what we've learned so far!  Review the code below and see if you can figure out what will be printed to the screen.
``` python
print ("Hello World!")
print()

for i in range(5):
	print (str(i) + " I'm alive!")
print()

basket=["apple","peach","pear","cherry"]
for fruit in basket:
	print (fruit)
print()

my_color={"red":1,"blue":2,"green":3}
for color in my_color:
	print (color + " %d" % my_color[color]);
print()

name = "Brett"
if name == "Brett":
	print ("Brett who?")
else:
	print ("Nice name!")
```

## Give it Try!
1. Go to directory \DevNetCode\&lt;your-name&gt;\coding-skills-sample-code\coding103-python-json
2. Run the python script:**loops.py** . Then open the file to review the source code. Close it when you are done.
3. Run the python script:**loops_ex.py** . Then open the file to review the source code. Close it when you are done.
4. Open file **json_parse-1.py** .  Using loops write Python code to print out **all** of the values for each of the json objects.  Run the code.
