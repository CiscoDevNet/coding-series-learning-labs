# Step 4. Parsing JSON With Python

We are going to build on your new knowledge of Python data types, and learn about JSON and how to parse it with Python. [JSON](http://www.json.org/) which stands for **Java Script Object Notation** consists of text-based name-value pairs making it simple for applications to store and exchange data.  It's designed to be lightweight and readable as well as minimal so there's not excessive text which is sometimes been the complaint of [XML](http://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_whatis.asp) which is another text-based option for exchanging and storing data.

The structure and parsing of JSON is very similar to Python dictionaries and lists.
<ol>
<li> In JSON data is set up in name value pairs just like a Python dictionary.  However, in JSON dictionaries are called objects.  For example, **{"car":"volvo", "fruit":"apple"}** is a JSON object. The object is assigned to a variable in the same manner as well: **var={"car":"volvo", "fruit":"apple"}**.  In addition, data is accessed the same way as when accessing data in a dictionary.  For example, to get the value for **fruit** we would enter **var["fruit"]** which would return **apple**. To display this value we enter **print(var["fruit"])** .</li><br/>

<li> As with Python JSON also uses **lists** which it calls **arrays**.  In JSON an array is typically nested in an object. For example, **{"donut":["chocolate","glazed","sprinkled"]}** .  Let's assign this object to a variable: **var1={"donut":["chocolate","glazed","sprinkled"]}**. If I wanted to get the chocolate donut, (you're getting hungry aren't you?), I would access it by entering **var1["donut"] [0]** which would return **chocolate** because it is the first element in the array. I could display the text by entering **print(var1["donut"] [0])**.</li><br/>

<li> JSON can also nest objects in objects with arrays inside.  For example: **{"donut":{"flavors":["chocolate","glazed","sprinkled"]}}**.  In this case to get the chocolate donut we need to dig a little deeper. First we assign it to a variable **myvar={"donut":{"flavors":["chocolate","glazed","sprinkled"]}}** . We access *chocolate* by entering **myvar["donut"]["flavors"][0]** . We can display it by entering **print(myvar["donut"]["flavors"][0])** .  For viewing purposes JSON is typically formatted to separate data types from each other to make it easier to read. So the example above would typically look like the picture below, but is still parsed the same way.</li><br/>

<li> JSON will also include objects inside a list.  For example: **{"type":"donut","flavors":{"flavor":[{"type":"chocolate","id":"1001"}, {"type":"glazed","id":"1002"},{"type":"sprinkled","id":"1003"}]}}**. So we need to dig a little deeper still to get our chocolate donut. First we assign it to a variable **myvar1={"type":"donut","flavors":{"flavor":[{"type":"chocolate","id":"1001"}, {"type":"glazed","id":"1002"},{"type":"sprinkled","id":"1003"}]}}** . We access *chocolate* by entering **myvar1["flavors"]["flavor"][0]["type"]** . We can display it by entering **print(myvar1["flavors"]["flavor"][0]["type"])**. As mentioned earlier for viewing purposes JSON is typically formatted.  The example above would typically look like the picture below, but is still parsed the same way.</li>

fruit={"cherry":"red", "lemon":"yellow", "lime":"greeen"}

food={“vegetables”:[“carrots”,“kale”,“cucumber”,”tomato”]}

cars={“sports”:{“porsche”:“Volkswagon”,“Viper”:“Dodge”,“Corvette”:“Chevy”}}

donut={"type":"donut","flavors":{"flavor":[{"type":"chocolate","id":"1001"}, {"type":"glazed","id":"1002"},{"type":"sprinkled","id":"1003"}]}}

Write the code to access and then display the requested items below
1. Access the value for "lemon" from the fruit variable.
2. Access "tomato" from the food variable.
3. Access the value for "Viper" from the cars variable.
4. Access the glazed value from the donut variable.

## Give it Try!
1. Go to directory \DevNetCode\&lt;your-name&gt;\coding-skills-sample-code\coding103-python-json
2. Open file **json_parse-1.py**
3. Write Python code to print out one value for each of the json objects.  Run the code.
