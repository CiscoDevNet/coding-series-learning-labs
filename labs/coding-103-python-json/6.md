# Step 6. Writing Your Own Functions

A function is a block of code that is run only when it's explicitly called.  For example, print() is a function written in Python that you've called many times.  Functions are written to modularize code to make it easy to read, easier to debug because it's located in one place and to reuse.  Essentially, you don't want to write code over and over again that does the same thing. Instead you would put it into a function and then call that function whenever you need it.

Let's look at the structure of a function, then we'll look at a simple example.  In Python a function is defined in the follow manner shown below.  The keyword **def** specifies that a function is defined which is then followed by the name of the function and optional arguments that are passed into it.

Let's look at some simple examples of functions.  The first function named **my_function** simply prints a statement.  The second function **brett** takes an argument called **val** which it passes to the function **range** and uses for looping.

Now let's look at these simple functions in a script to see how they're called.  When this script is run, starting from the top of the script, the Python interpretor looks at what it should run now.  It sees the call to print and executes that.  It then sees the next two defined functions, makes note of them, but does not run them because they are not explicitly called.  Continuing down the script it then sees the call to **function my_function** and executes it.  Finally, it sees the call to **function brett** with the argument of 5 passed in and executes it.
```python

print ("I'm not a function")

def my_function():
        print("Hey I'm a function!")

def brett(val):
    for i in range(val):
        print("I'm a function with args!")

my_function()
brett(5)
```
As a result the output occurs as shown below.

## Putting it all Together
You ran the sample code below in the [Coding 102 Rest Python Learning Lab](/#/lab/coding-102-rest-python-ga/step/1), but that was before you knew how to write Python.  Now you've learned the basics about variables, operators, scope, parsing JSON, loops and functions.  Review the functions and how they are called.  Check out the dictionaries that are created and assigned to variables along with how the JSON data is parsed.  

#### get-network-devices.py
This sample code uses the network-device REST function call to retrieve a list of the network devices. A network device is a component such as a router, switch or hub used to connect workstations or devices to a network so that they can share data and other resources.  Our goal is to find the network devices and display information about them.


```python
# import requests library
import requests

#import json library
import json

controller='devnetapi.cisco.com/sandbox/apic_em'

def getTicket():
	# put the ip address or dns of your apic-em controller in this url
	url = "https://" + controller + "/api/v1/ticket"

	#the username and password to access the APIC-EM Controller
	payload = {"username":"devnetuser","password":"Cisco123!"}

	#Content type must be included in the header
	header = {"content-type": "application/json"}

	#Performs a POST on the specified url to get the service ticket
	response= requests.post(url,data=json.dumps(payload), headers=header, verify=False)

	#convert response to json format
	r_json=response.json()

	#parse the json to get the service ticket
	ticket = r_json["response"]["serviceTicket"]

	return ticket


def getNetworkDevices(ticket):
	# URL for network device REST API call to get list of existing devices on the network.
	url = "https://" + controller + "/api/v1/network-device"

	#Content type must be included in the header as well as the ticket
	header = {"content-type": "application/json", "X-Auth-Token":ticket}

	# this statement performs a GET on the specified network-device url
	response = requests.get(url, headers=header, verify=False)

	# json.dumps serializes the json into a string and allows us to
	# print the response in a 'pretty' format with indentation etc.
	print ("Network Devices = ")
	print (json.dumps(response.json(), indent=4, separators=(',', ': ')))

  #convert data to json format.
	r_json=response.json()

  #Iterate through network device data and print the id and series name of each device
	for i in r_json["response"]:
		print(i["id"] + "   " + i["series"])

#call the functions
theTicket=getTicket()
getNetworkDevices(theTicket)
```


To run this code sample:
1. Go to directory **coding102-REST-python-ga**.  In the terminal type:
    **cd \DevNetCode\&lt;your-name&gt;\coding-skills-sample-code\coding102-REST-python-ga**
2. Assign the APIC-EM Controller IP address or DNS to the **controller** variable.
    * Open the file **get-network-devices.py**.  For example, in Windows type: **get-network-devices.py**
    * *If you are not using your own APIC-EM Controller*, use the [DevNet Sandbox](https://developer.cisco.com/site/devnet/sandbox/) Always-On APIC-EM Lab: https:[]()//devnetapi.cisco.com/sandbox/apic_em
        * controller='devnetapi.cisco.com/sandbox/apic_em'
3. Save the file. If encoding type is an option select **UTF-8**.
4. Type the python command and then the filename at the command prompt, and press the return key.
5. The program should execute or display an error message.

You should see a result like the following.  For purposes of brevity some records have been removed.

## Give it a Try
* Open file **json_parse-1.py** .  Create and call two functions that parse the JSON data.  You may use the code you wrote in Step 5 to complete the functions.  Run the code.
* Run the file \DevNetCode\&lt;your-name&gt;\coding-skills-sample-code\coding102-REST-python-ga\get-network-devices.py .  Review the JSON data printed.  Then open the file and modify it to print out other data. Run the code.


### Congratulations!  You've completed Coding 103!
