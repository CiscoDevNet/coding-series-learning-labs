# Step 5. Build Network Topology

In this step we're going to get the topology then parse the data to determine and display how devices link to one another and their link status.


#### build-topology.py
This sample code uses the application REST function call to retrieve a list of devices called nodes and links which are the interfaces that connect them. Our goal is to find the devices and display information about them and how they connect to other devices.


```python
# import requests library
import requests

#import json library
import json

# Disable warnings
requests.packages.urllib3.disable_warnings()

#controller='sandboxapic.cisco.com'
controller='devnetapi.cisco.com/sandbox/apic_em'


def getTicket():
	# put the ip address or dns of your apic-em controller in this url
	url = "https://" + controller + "/api/v1/ticket"

	#the username and password to access the APIC-EM Controller
	payload = {"username":"devnetuser","password":"Cisco123!"}

	#Content type must be included in the header
	header = {"content-type": "application/json"}

	#Performs a POST on the specified url to get the service ticket
	response= requests.post(url,data=json.dumps(payload), headers=header, verify=False)

	print (response)

	#convert response to json format
	r_json=response.json()

	#parse the json to get the service ticket
	ticket = r_json["response"]["serviceTicket"]

	return ticket



def getTopology(ticket):
	# URL for topology REST API call to get list of existing devices on the network, and build topology
	url = "https://" + controller + "/api/v1/topology/physical-topology"

	#Content type as well as the ticket must be included in the header
	header = {"content-type": "application/json", "X-Auth-Token":ticket}

	# this statement performs a GET on the specified network device url
	response = requests.get(url, headers=header, verify=False)

	# json.dumps serializes the json into a string and allows us to
	# print the response in a 'pretty' format with indentation etc.
	print ("Topology = ")
	print (json.dumps(response.json(), indent=4, separators=(',', ': ')))

	#convert data to json format.
	r_json=response.json()

	#Iterate through network device data and list the nodes, their interfaces, status and to what they connect

theTicket=getTicket()
getTopology(theTicket)
```

Let's look at what the code is doing.  We'll focus on the key code changes.
* *def getTopology(theTicket):*
    * We define the function named getTopology.  This function reads in the topology data.  It parses the nodes which are devices on the network and displays some information about them.  It also parses the link data which are interfaces that connect the nodes and displays information about how they connect the devices and their status. The passed in parameter 'theTicket' is used for authorization purposes.
* *for n in r_json["response"]["nodes"]:*
    * We read the dictionary data for each node into n from which we will parse the data.
* *if "platformId" in n:*
    * Checking that the node data in n contains a 'platformId' key.  Some records don't have this key so different field data would need to be accessed.
* *if "startPortName" in i:*
    * Checking that the interface data in i contains a 'startPortName' key.  Some records don't have this key so different field data would need to be accessed.


To run this code sample:
1. Go to directory **coding102-REST-python-ga**.  In the terminal type:
    **cd \DevNetCode\&lt;your-name&gt;\coding-skills-sample-code\coding102-REST-python-ga**
2. Assign the APIC-EM Controller IP address or DNS to the **controller** variable.
    * Open the file **build-topology.py**.  For example, in Windows type: **notepad build-topology.py**
    * *If you are not using your own APIC-EM Controller*, use the [DevNet Sandbox](https://developer.cisco.com/site/devnet/sandbox/) Always-On APIC-EM Lab: [sandboxapic.cisco.com](https://sandboxapic.cisco.com)
        * controller='sandboxapic.cisco.com'
3. Save the file. If encoding type is an option select **UTF-8**.
4. Type the python command and then the filename at the command prompt, and press the return key.
    * *On Windows type*: **py -3 build-topology.py**.  Or type: **python build-topology.py**
    * *On Mac OS or Linux type*: **python3 build-topology.py**
5. The program should execute or display an error message.

    You should see a result like the following.  For purposes of brevity some records have been removed.

## Things to Try
* After running the script review the node data printed. Modify the source code by replacing the label key with another key such as role or nodeType.  Run the script again and determine the change of the data displayed.
* Review the printed topology data and determine how many host devices exist and to which devices they connect.
* Starting from the cloud node, use the topology data provided to draw a picture of the first three layers of the topology. Hint: look for matching devices specified by the Label attribute.  For example, the cloud node connects to four devices with one device being Branch-Router1. Determine which devices Branch-Router1 connects to by finding it in the Label field of the topology data.  Then do the same steps for the other three devices.
