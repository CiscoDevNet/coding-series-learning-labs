## Step 4. Parse the JSON in the response and write the devices to a file
The following part of the code accomplishes these steps of the application:

* Loop through the list of devices in the json response
* If the type of the device matches the type chosen by the user
    * Write the device id and type to the file

```python
#open the file for writing
file= open(file_name, "w")
logging.info("File opened:" + file_name)
logging.info("Begin writing list:" + file_name)
file.write ("The list of devices of type: " + type + "\n" )

#set our parent as the top level response object
parent =  get_devices_json["response"]

#Parse the Json data.  For each device returned, write the networkDeviceId and
#type value to the file if the type corresponds to what we're seeking.
for item in parent:
	lowerCaseType=item["type"].lower()
	if lowerCaseType.find(type)!=-1:
		file.write ("id = " + item["id"] + " type = " + item["type"] + "\n")

print ("Finished writing list ...")
logging.info("End writing list:" + file_name)
```
Let's look at what is going on in the code.

* First, we create a variable called **parent** for the top level object in our device list response
* Then we open a file, ** with file=open(file_name, "w")**, using the file name that the user entered earlier.
* Then, we write some information to our log showing that the file is open.
* Next, loop through the array of devices in the json object using **for item in parent:**
    * Check to see if each device is the type of device that the user selected
    * If the type of device matches, then write the device info to the file.

### Give it a try!

To run this code sample:
1. Go to directory **coding207-putting-it-together-ga**.  In the terminal type:
    **cd \DevNetCode\&lt;your-name&gt;\coding-skills-sample-code\coding207-putting-it-together-ga**
2. Assign the APIC-EM Controller IP address or DNS to the **controller_url** variable.
    * Open the file **create-device-list.py**.  For example, in Windows type: **notepad create_device-list.py**
    * *If you are not using your own APIC-EM Controller*, use the [DevNet Sandbox](https://developer.cisco.com/site/devnet/sandbox/) Always-On APIC-EM Lab: [sandboxapic.cisco.com:9443](https://sandboxapic.cisco.com:9443)
        * controller_url='https://sandboxapic.cisco.com:9443'
3. Save the file. If encoding type is an option select **UTF-8**.
4. Type the python command and then the filename at the command prompt, and press the return key.
    * *On Windows type*: **py -3 create-device-list.py**.  Or type: **python create-device-list.py**
    * *On Mac OS or Linux type*: **python3 create-device-list.py**
5. The program should execute or display an error message.

You should see a result like this:

![](/posts/files/coding-207-putting-it-together-ga/assets/images/create-device-list-1.png)

At the directory type 'dir'.  You should see three files.
![](/posts/files/coding-207-putting-it-together-ga/assets/images/create-device-list-2.png)

Open the file that you specified for the device list.  You should see a result like this:

![](/posts/files/coding-207-putting-it-together-ga/assets/images/create-device-list-3.png)


Open the file that you specified for the log file.  You should see a result like this.  Notice the API calls and more that were logged.
