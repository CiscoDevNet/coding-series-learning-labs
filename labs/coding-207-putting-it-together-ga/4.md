## Step 4. Parse the JSON in the response and write the devices to a file
The following code performs these steps:

* Loop through the list of devices in the JSON response.
* If the device type matches the type chosen by the user, write the device id and type to the file.

```python
# Open the file for writing
file= open(file_name, "w")
logging.info("File opened:" + file_name)
logging.info("Begin writing list:" + file_name)
file.write ("The list of " + type + " devices \n" )

# Set your parent as the top level response object
parent =  get_devices_json["response"]

# Parse the JSON data. For each device returned, write the networkDeviceId and
# type value to the file if the type corresponds to what you're seeking.
for item in parent:
	lowerCaseType=item["type"].lower()
	if lowerCaseType.find(type)!=-1:
		file.write ("id = " + item["id"] + " type = " + item["type"] + "\n")

print ("Finished writing list ...")
logging.info("End writing list:" + file_name)
```
Now, look at what is going on in the code.

* First, create a variable called `parent` for the top level object in your device list response
* Then, open a file, `with file=open(file_name, "w")`, using the filename the user entered earlier.
* Then, write some information to a log showing that the file is open.
* Next, loop through the array of devices in the JSON object using `for item in parent:`
    * Check to see if each device is the type of device the user selected
    * If the type of device matches, then write the device info to the file.

### Give it a try!

Here is the full source code for this example:

```python
# Import requests library
import requests

# Import json library
import json

# Import logging library
import logging

# Disable warnings
requests.packages.urllib3.disable_warnings()

To run this code sample:
1. In a terminal, enter:
    `cd \DevNetCode\~your-name~\coding-skills-sample-code\coding207-putting-it-together-ga`
2. Assign the DNA Center IP address or DNS to the `controller_url` variable.
    * Open the file `create-device-list.py`. For example, in Windows, enter: `notepad create_device-list.py`
    * *If you are not using your DNA Center*, use the [DevNet Sandbox](https://developer.cisco.com/site/devnet/sandbox/) DNA Center Lab: [sandboxapic.cisco.com](https://sandboxdnac.cisco.com)
        * controller_url='https://sandboxdnac.cisco.com'
3. Save the file. If encoding type is an option, select `UTF-8`.
4. At the command prompt, enter the `python` command followed by the filename.
    * On Windows, enter: `py -3 create-device-list.py` or `python create-device-list.py`
    * On Mac OS or Linux, enter: `python3 create-device-list.py`
5. The program should run or display an error message.

You should see a result like this:

![](/posts/files/coding-207-putting-it-together-ga/assets/images/create-device-list-1.png)

At the directory type 'dir'. You should see three files.
![](/posts/files/coding-207-putting-it-together-ga/assets/images/create-device-list-2.png)

Open the file that you specified for the device list. You should see a result like this:

![](/posts/files/coding-207-putting-it-together-ga/assets/images/create-device-list-3.png)


Open the file that you specified for the log file. You should see a result like this. Notice the API calls and more that were logged.
