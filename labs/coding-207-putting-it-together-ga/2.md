## Step 2. Configure logging and ask the user for input
The following part of the code accomplishes these steps of the application:

* Specify the file to use for logging and specify the logging level
* Ask the user if they want to save a list of routers or switches
* Ask the user for the filename that they want to use for the list of devices when saved

```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(filename='mylog.log',format='%(asctime)s %(levelname)s: %(message)s',datefmt='%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p', level=logging.DEBUG)

logging.info("Begin")
logging.info("Asking user for device type")
# Ask the user what kind of list they want to create
device_type = input("Do you want to create a list of [r]outers or [s]witches?")

# create a variable called type to hold which kind of device to save
if device_type == 'r':
        type = "router"
else:
        type = "switch"

logging.info("Device type is " + type)

# Ask user for name of the file
file_name = input("Specify the file name to use for the list:")

logging.info("Will save device list to " + file_name)

```
Let's look at what is going on in the code.

* This line **logging.basicConfig(filename='mylog.log',format='%(asctime)s %(levelname)s: %(message)s',datefmt='%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p', level=logging.DEBUG)** sets the default logging level to be Debug, and formats the logging output to include the date and time.
    * We also specify that we want to log to the file **mylog.log**.
* We do some logging to indicate where we are in the application. Note that there are different levels of categorizing logs such as debug, info, warn ...etc.  In the logging below we use the info level.
    * **logging.info("Begin")**
    * **logging.info("Asking user for device type")**
* Next we ask the user what kind of device they want to save in the list
    * **device_type = input("Do you want to create a list of [r]outers or [s]witches?")**
* And then, we ask the user for the filename **file_name = input("Specify the file name to use for the list:")**


### Things to think about
* What other steps should we include in the log?
