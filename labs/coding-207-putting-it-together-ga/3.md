## Step 3. Using the APIC-EM APIs to retrieve the device list
The following part of the code accomplishes these steps of the application:

* Use the APIC-EM REST API to create a service ticket to use for authentication when making API calls
* Use the APIC-EM REST API to get the total count of devices
* Use the APIC-EM REST API to get the list of network devices

```python
# Get Count of Devices
# All of our REST calls will use the url for the APIC EM Controller as the base URL
# So lets define a variable for the controller IP or DNS so we don't have to keep typing it
controller_url = "https://sandboxapic.cisco.com"

# put the ip address or dns of your apic-em controller in this url
ticket_url = controller_url + '/api/v1/ticket'

#the username and password to access the APIC-EM Controller
payload = {"username":"devnetuser","password":"Cisco123!"}

#Content type must be included in the header
header = {"content-type": "application/json"}

#Performs a POST on the specified url.
response= requests.post(ticket_url,data=json.dumps(payload), headers=header, verify=False)

#convert response to json format
r_json=response.json()

#parse the json to get the service ticket
ticket = r_json["response"]["serviceTicket"]

# Specify URL for the devices count
devices_count_url = controller_url + '/api/v1/network-device/count'

logging.info("Calling APIC-EM API url:" + devices_count_url)

#Content type as well as the ticket must be included in the header
header = {"content-type": "application/json", "X-Auth-Token":ticket}

# Perform GET on devices_count_url
devices_count_response = requests.get(devices_count_url, headers=header, verify=False)

#parse the returned jason to the get count
count = devices_count_response.json()["response"]

logging.debug("API response: " + json.dumps(devices_count_response.json(), indent=4, separators=(',', ': ')))

# Get Devices
# This function allows you to view a list of all the devices in the network.
# We will specify that the list should start with the first device (1) and end with the last device #which is the count of all the devices we retrieved in the previous step
get_devices_url = controller_url + '/api/v1/network-device/1/' + str(count)

logging.info("Calling APIC-EM API url:" + get_devices_url)

#Perform GET on get_devices_url
get_devices_response = requests.get(get_devices_url, headers=header, verify=False)

# The json method of the response object returned by requests.get returns the request body in json format
get_devices_json = get_devices_response.json()

logging.debug("API response: " + json.dumps(get_devices_json, indent=4, separators=(',', ': ')))

```
Let's look at what is going on in the code.

* Using the [APIC-EM API Reference](http://devnetapic.cisco.com), we can see that the url **api/v1/ticket** will return the service ticket that's used to authorize calls to the APIC-EM APIs.  Like the other 'post' and 'get' calls it uses the Requests library to make a call to the APIC-EM Controller to retrieve the response data.
* The url **api/v1/network-device/count** will return the total count of devices
* This statement **devices_count_response = requests.get(devices_count_url, headers=header, verify=False)** makes the 'get' call to retrieve the device count.
* **devices_count_response** will contain the response returned from the API
* It is useful to log the response to the log file.  This can be really helpful when debugging.
    * **logging.debug("API response: " + json.dumps(devices_count_response.json(), indent=4, separators=(',', ': ')))**
* Next, we use **/api/v1/network-device/{startIndex}/{endIndex}** APIC-EM API call to retrieve the full list of devices
    * We specify that we want to start at record 1 and get the full list by specifying 1 and the count as the start and end index values.
    * **get_devices_url = controller_url + '/api/v1/network-device/1/' + str(count)**
* This statement **get_devices_response = requests.get(get_devices_url, verify=False)** uses the Requests library to make the API call.
* We also log the response from this API call to the log file.
    * **logging.debug("API response: " + json.dumps(get_devices_response.json(), indent=4, separators=(',', ': ')))**


### Things to think about
* What other APIC-EM APIs in the [APIC-EM API Reference](http://devnetapic.cisco.com) would you like to try?
