## Step 3: Use the DNA Center APIs to retrieve the device list
The following code uses the DNA Center REST API to perform the these steps:

* Create a token to use for authentication when making API calls.
* Get the total count of devices.
* Get the list of network devices.

```python
# Get Count of Devices
# All of your REST calls use the URL for the DNA Center as the base URL.
# Define a variable for the controller IP or DNS so you don't have to keep entering it.
controller_url = "https://sandboxdnac.cisco.com"

# Put the IP address or DNS of your DNA Center in this URL
ticket_url = controller_url + '/api/v1/ticket'

# The username and password to access the DNA Center
payload = {"username":"devnetuser","password":"Cisco123!"}

# Content type must be included in the header
header = {"content-type": "application/json"}

# Perform a POST on the specified url.
response= requests.post(ticket_url,data=json.dumps(payload), headers=header, verify=False)

# Convert response to JSON format
r_json=response.json()

# Parse the JSON to get the token
ticket = r_json["response"]["serviceTicket"]

# Specify URL for the devices count
devices_count_url = controller_url + '/api/v1/network-device/count'

logging.info("Calling DNA Center API url:" + devices_count_url)

# Include the content type and ticket in the header
header = {"content-type": "application/json", "X-Auth-Token":ticket}

# Perform GET on devices_count_url
devices_count_response = requests.get(devices_count_url, headers=header, verify=False)

# Parse the returned jason to the get count
count = devices_count_response.json()["response"]

logging.debug("API response: " + json.dumps(devices_count_response.json(), indent=4, separators=(',', ': ')))

# Get Devices
# This function enables you to view a list of the devices in the network.
# You specify that the list should start with the first device (1) and end with the last device # which is the count of the devices you retrieved in the previous step
get_devices_url = controller_url + '/api/v1/network-device/1/' + str(count)

logging.info("Calling DNA Center API url:" + get_devices_url)

# Perform GET on get_devices_url
get_devices_response = requests.get(get_devices_url, headers=header, verify=False)

# The JSON method of the response object returned by requests.get returns the request body in JSON format
get_devices_json = get_devices_response.json()

logging.debug("API response: " + json.dumps(get_devices_json, indent=4, separators=(',', ': ')))
```

Now, look at what is going on in the code.

* Using the [DNA Center API Reference](https://developer.cisco.com/site/dna-center-rest-api/), you can see that the URL `api/v1/ticket` returns the token that's used to authorize calls to the DNA Center APIs. Like the other 'post' and 'get' calls, it uses the Requests library to make a call to the DNA Center to retrieve the response data.
* `api/v1/network-device/count` returns the total count of devices.
* This statement `devices_count_response = requests.get(devices_count_url, headers=header, verify=False)` makes the 'get' call to retrieve the device count.
* `devices_count_response`  contain the response returned from the API
* It is useful to log the response to the log file. This can be helpful when debugging.
    * `logging.debug("API response: " + json.dumps(devices_count_response.json(), indent=4, separators=(',', ': ')))`
* Next, `/api/v1/network-device/{startIndex}/{endIndex}` DNA Center API call retrieves the full list of devices
    * Specify to start at record 1 and get the full list. Specify `1` and the count as the start and end index values.
    * `get_devices_url = controller_url + '/api/v1/network-device/1/' + str(count)`
* This statement `get_devices_response = requests.get(get_devices_url, verify=False)` uses the Requests library to make the API call.
* Log the response from this API call to the log file.
    * `logging.debug("API response: " + json.dumps(get_devices_response.json(), indent=4, separators=(',', ': ')))`


### Things to think about
* What other DNA Center APIs in the [DNA Center API Reference](https://developer.cisco.com/site/dna-center-rest-api/) would you like to try?
* For more information on using the Requests library to make API calls, see [Coding 102: Calling REST APIs from Python Learning Lab](/lab/coding-102-rest-python-ga/step/1).

### Next step

Proceed to Step 4: Parse the JSON in the response and write the devices to a file.
