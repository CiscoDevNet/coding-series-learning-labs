# Coding 207: Putting it all together

In this Learning Lab, you will use all of the Coding 200 series skills together in one program to retrieve and save a list of devices of a specified type.


## Objective ##

Completion Time: 20 minutes

* Understand how to prompt a user to enter data
* Understand how to use the data entered by the user
* Understand how to retrieve data using the APIC-EM REST APIs
* Understand how to save data to a file
* Understand how to use the logging module


## Prerequisites

**Background**
* We recommend that you complete the [Coding 101: Rest Basics Learning Lab](/#/labs/coding-101-rest-basics-ga/step/1) and the [Coding 102: Calling REST APIs from Python Learning Lab](/#/labs/coding-102-rest-python-ga/step/1) before you start this lab.

**Access to an APIC-EM Controller**
* To run these code samples, you will need access to an APIC-EM controller.
* **If you are not using your own APIC-EM Controller**, use the [DevNet Sandbox](https://developer.cisco.com/site/devnet/sandbox/) Always-On APIC-EM Lab: [https://sandboxapic.cisco.com](https://sandboxapic.cisco.com).

**Python**
* To run the code samples, you need to have Python 3 installed on your machine.
* **If you are working on a DevNet Learning Lab PC at a DevNet event**, Python 3.4.2 is already installed.
* See **How to Set up Your Own Computer** section above for how to install Python on your own machine.

**Python Requests Library**
* These code samples use the Python Requests Library to simplify making REST API calls.
* **If you are working on a DevNet Learning Lab PC at a DevNet event**, the Requests Library is already installed.
* See **How to Set up Your Own Computer** section above for how to install the Requests Library on your own machine.

**Clone Git Repo**
* **If you are working on a DevNet Learning Lab PC at a DevNet event**
    * Open the Git Command window by clicking on the *Git CMD* icon on the Task Bar or click on the Start button, then in the Run bar type: **git cmd** and press the **Enter** key.
* **If you are working from your own workstation**, on your desktop open a command terminal.
* Go to the root directory by typing: `cd \`
* Create a directory called 'C:\DevNetCode\yourname' by typing: `mkdir DevNetCode\<your-name>`
    * For example: `mkdir DevNetCode\brTiller`
* Go to the new directory by typing: `cd \DevNetCode\<your-name>`
    * For example: `cd \DevNetCode\brTiller`
* Clone the coding skills sample code from GitHub.  Enter the command below.
```
git clone https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/coding-skills-sample-code
```

Inside the directory you created you should now see directory 'coding-skills-sample-code'.<br/><br/>

**Find the APIC-EM API Resources**

We are going to use the APIC-EM API as an example of a REST API in this lab.  So before we begin, we need to locate the APIC-EM API Reference on DevNet.

1. In the browser navigate to <a href="https://developer.cisco.com" target="_blank">DevNet</a>
    * If you have not yet created a DevNet userid click "Register" and follow the instructions.
    * After registering with DevNet, use your user id to login.<br/><br/>

2. Use the menu at the top to navigate directly to the APIC-EM developer resources.<br/><br/>

3. You will also want to open the [API reference doc](https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/apiplatform/cisco-dev/#/portals/organizations/de91ddd1-9fb8-4731-8bce-03f47c3ba41a/apis/56056/versions/58124/pages/75870) in a separate tab while you are working on this lab.<br/><br/>

## Step 1. Introduction

In this Learning Lab, we are going to use all of the skills that we covered in these learning labs together in one application.

* [Coding 101: Rest Basics](/#/labs/coding-101-rest-basics-ga/step/1)
* [Coding 102: Calling REST APIs from Python](/#/labs/coding-102-rest-python-ga/step/1)
* [Coding 202: Parsing JSON using Python](/#/labs/coding-202-parsing-json/step/1)
* [Coding 203: Getting input from a user in Python](/#/labs/coding-203-getting-input/step/1)
* [Coding 204: Reading data from a file using Python](/#/labs/coding-204-reading-a-file/step/1)
* [Coding 205: Writing data to a file using Python](/#/labs/coding-205-writing-file-ga/step/1)
* [Coding 206: Using the logging module in Python](/#/labs/coding-206-logging/step/1)

Here is the outline of what the application will do:

* Specify the file to use for logging and specify the logging level
* Ask the user if they want to save a list of routers or switches
* Ask the user for the filename that they want to use for the list of devices when saved
* Use the APIC-EM REST API to create an authorization ticket
* Use the APIC-EM REST API to get the total count of devices
* Use the APIC-EM REST API to get the list of network devices
* Loop through the list of devices in the json response
* If the type of the device is the type chosen by the user
    * Write the device id and type to the file


Let's get started!
