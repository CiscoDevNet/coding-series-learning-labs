# Coding 207: Putting it all together

In this Learning Lab, you use all of the Coding 200 series skills together in one program. This program retrieves and saves a list of devices that have a user-specified device type.


## Objective ##

Completion Time: 20 minutes

Understand how to do the following:
* Prompt a user to enter data.
* Use the data entered by the user.
* Retrieve data using the APIC-EM REST APIs.
* Save data to a file.
* Use the logging module.


## Prerequisites

**Background**
* Before starting this lab, complete the [Coding 101: Rest Basics Learning Lab](/lab/coding-101-rest-basics-ga/step/1) and the [Coding 102: Calling REST APIs from Python Learning Lab](/lab/coding-102-rest-python-ga/step/1).

**Access to an APIC-EM Controller**
* To run these code samples, you need access to an APIC-EM controller.
* **If you are not using your APIC-EM Controller**, use the [DevNet Sandbox](https://developer.cisco.com/site/devnet/sandbox/) APIC-EM Lab: [https://sandboxapicem.cisco.com](https://sandboxapicem.cisco.com).

**Python**
* To run the code samples, you need to have Python 3 installed on your computer.
* **If you are working on a DevNet Learning Lab computer at a DevNet event**, Python 3.x is already installed.

For more information, click the "How to Set Up Your Computer" link at the top of this lab.

**Python Requests Library**
* These code samples use the Python Requests Library to simplify making REST API calls.
* **If you are working on a DevNet Learning Lab computer at a DevNet event**, the Requests Library is already installed.

For more information, click the "How to Set Up Your Computer" link at the top of this lab.

**Clone Git Repo**
* **If you are working on a DevNet Learning Lab computer at a DevNet event**
    * Open the Git Command window by clicking the *Git CMD* icon on the Task Bar or click the Start button. Then, in the Run bar, enter: `git cmd`.
* **If you are working from your computer**, on your computer open a command terminal.
* Go to the root directory by entering: `cd \`
* Create a directory called 'C:\DevNetCode\yourname' by entering: `mkdir DevNetCode\<your-name>`
    * For example: `mkdir DevNetCode\brTiller`
* Go to the new directory by entering: `cd \DevNetCode\<your-name>`
    * For example: `cd \DevNetCode\brTiller`
* Clone the coding skills sample code from GitHub. Enter the following command.
```
git clone https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/coding-skills-sample-code
```

Inside the directory you created , you should see a new directory, 'coding-skills-sample-code'.<br/><br/>

**Find the APIC-EM API Resources**

You are going to use the APIC-EM API as an example of a REST API in this lab. So before you begin, locate the APIC-EM resources on DevNet.

1. In the browser, navigate to <a href="https://developer.cisco.com" target="_blank">DevNet</a>
    * Click the **Login** link located at the top right of the webpage.

    * On the Log In webpage enter your log in credentials (CCO ID) and click the **Log In** button
    ![](/posts/files/coding-207-putting-it-together-ga/assets/images/register.png)<br/>
       * If you do not have a Cisco Connection Online ID (CCO ID) click the **Register Now** button and follow the instructions. When done, return to the Log In webpage and enter your credentials.
<br/><br/>
2. Use the menu at the top to navigate directly to the APIC-EM developer resources.
   * Click the **Technologies** link to access the Technology menu. Inside the menu, click **Networking**  followed by **APIC-EM**<br/>

    <br/><br/>

3. You are now at the APIC-EM web portal. Open the API reference doc in a separate tab while you are working on this lab.<br/>

## Step 1. Introduction

In this Learning Lab, you are going to use all of the skills that you covered in these learning labs together in one application.

* [Coding 101: Rest Basics](/lab/coding-101-rest-basics-ga/step/1)
* [Coding 102: Calling REST APIs from Python](/lab/coding-102-rest-python-ga/step/1)
* [Coding 202: Parsing JSON using Python](/lab/coding-202-parsing-json/step/1)
* [Coding 203: Getting input from a user in Python](/lab/coding-203-getting-input/step/1)
* [Coding 204: Reading data from a file using Python](/lab/coding-204-reading-a-file/step/1)
* [Coding 205: Writing data to a file using Python](/lab/coding-205-writing-file-ga/step/1)
* [Coding 206: Using the logging module in Python](/lab/coding-206-logging/step/1)

Here is the outline of what the application will do:

* Specify the file to use for logging and specify the logging level.
* Ask the user if they want to save a list of routers or switches.
* Ask the user for the filename that they want to use for the list of devices when saved.
* Use the APIC-EM REST API to create an authorization ticket.
* Use the APIC-EM REST API to get the total count of devices.
* Use the APIC-EM REST API to get the list of network devices.
* Loop through the list of devices in the JSON response.
* If the device type is the type chosen by the user, write the device id and type to the file.


Now, get started!
